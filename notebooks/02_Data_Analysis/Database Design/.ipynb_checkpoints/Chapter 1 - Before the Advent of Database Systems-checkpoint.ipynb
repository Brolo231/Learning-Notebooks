    "# Before the advent of database systems \n",
    "\n",
    "**Before modern databases, organizations used file-based systems to manage data. Each department or application maintained its own data files, often independently. Over time, this approach led to major inefficiencies and management issues, prompting the shift to the database approach.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## üóÉÔ∏è File-Based System\n",
    "\n",
    "A file-based system stores data in separate files, each manipulated by specific application programs developed for individual departments (e.g., banking systems handling accounts, loans, and statements).\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ùå Disadvantages**\n",
    "1. Data Redundancy ‚Äì Same information stored in multiple places, leading to wasted space and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tData Isolation ‚Äì Data scattered across files makes retrieval difficult for new applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tIntegrity Problems ‚Äì Maintaining consistent and correct data is challenging due to hard-coded constraints in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tSecurity Problems ‚Äì Inconsistent and ad-hoc access controls make enforcing privileges difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tConcurrency Access Issues ‚Äì Files are often locked when in use, preventing simultaneous access by multiple users.\n",
    "\n",

    "## üíæ Database Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**The database approach emerged to solve these issues by centralizing data management through database management software (DBMS).**\n",
    "- Provides structured, efficient storage, manipulation, and retrieval of data.\n",
    "- Supports business operations, including tracking customers, employees, orders, and products.\n",
    "- Enables concurrent multi-user access, data integrity, and security control.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä The Meaning of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data are factual pieces of information ‚Äî such as measurements, statistics, or attributes of people, places, or events.\n",
    "- Can be stored in various forms: spreadsheets, ledgers, lists, or databases.\n",
    "- A database provides a powerful, mechanical means to organize, search, retrieve, and process information efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîë Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency: Database‚Äôs ability to allow multiple users to access the same record simultaneously.\n",
    "- Data Element: A single fact or piece of information.\n",
    "- Data Inconsistency: Conflicts between different copies of the same data.\n",
    "- Data Isolation: Determines when and how data changes become visible to other users or systems.\n",
    "- Data Integrity: Ensures data is correct and consistent.\n",
    "- Data Redundancy: Occurs when a field needs to be updated in multiple places.\n",
    "- Database Approach: Centralized management of organizational data.\n",
    "- Database Management Software: Tool for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data efficiently.\n",
    "- File-Based System: System where application programs manage their own data files independently.\n",

    "1. Discuss each of the following terms:\n",
    "    - 1.1 data\n",
    "    - 1.2 field\n",
    "    - 1.3 record\n",
    "    - 1.4 file\n",

    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "    1.1) Data are raw facts or figures collected for reference, analysis, or processing. <br>\n",
    "    1.2) A field is an attribute (or column) of a record that stores values and generally has a specific data type <br>\n",
    "    1.3) A record is a collection of related fields that describe one entity.\n",
    "Example: Name, Age, Height ‚Üí ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù, 23, 178.3 <br>\n",
    "    1.4) A file is a collection of related records stored together as a single unit, often representing a dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What is data redundancy?\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "    Data redundancy occurs when the same information is stored in multiple places, causing duplication and inconsistencies when data is updated.\n",

    "3. Discuss the disadvantages of file-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "    File-based systems can lead to data isolation, redundancy, reduced data integrity, and poor data quality. \n",

    "\n",
    "4. Explain the difference between data and information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "    Data are raw, unprocessed facts, while information is processed data that provides meaning or insight. \n",

    "5. Use Figure 1.2 (below) to answer the following questions.\n",
    "    - 5.1 In the table, how many records does the file contain?\n",
    "    - 5.2 How many fields are there per record?\n",
    "    - 5.3 What problem would you encounter if you wanted to produce a listing by city?\n",
    "    - 5.4 How would you solve this problem by altering the file structure?\n",

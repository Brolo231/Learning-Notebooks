\n\n- a list is a collection of items in a particular order\n\nif you ask python to print a list, python returns its representation of the list, including the square brackets: \n\n```\n>>> bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\n>>> print(bicycles) \n['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## accessing elements in a list\n\n- lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling python the position, or index, of the item desired\n- to access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets.\n\n\n### \ud83c\udd7e\ufe0f -> 1\ufe0f\u20e3 index positions start at 0, not 1\n\n- python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1. this is true of most programming languages, and the reason has to do with how the list operations are implemented at a lower level.\n\n### \u20121\ufe0f\u20e3 negative index values \n\n- python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. if you ask for the item at index ```-1```, python always returns the last item in the list:\n\n-this convention extends to other negative index values as well. the index -2 returns the second item from the end of the list, the index -3 returns the third item from the end, and so forth.\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## modifying elements in a list \n\n- to change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have.\n\n### appending elements to a list \n\n- when you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end of the list.\n\n```\n>>> x = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> x.append('d')\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n```\n\n### inserting elements into a list\n\n- you can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() method. you do this by specifying the index of the new element and the value of the new item:\n\n\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n>>> motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati)\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n```\n\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## removing elements from a list \n\n- if you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can use the del statement:\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n>>> del motorcycles[0]\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n['yamaha', 'suzuki']\n```\n\n### removing an item using the pop() method\n\n- the pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it unlike the del statement\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n>>> popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n>>> print(popped_motorcycle)\n```\n\n### removing an item by value\n\n- sometimes you won\u2019t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list. if you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method.\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n>>> motorcycles.remove('ducati')\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n```\n\n### note: \n\nthe ```remove()``` method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. if there\u2019s a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you\u2019ll need to use a loop to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## organizing a list\n\nsometimes we want to present information in a particular order. python provides a number of different ways to organize lists. \n\n### sorting a list permanently with the sort() method\n\nwe can use sort() to sort items alphabetically or reverse-alphabetical order. \n\n```\n>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n>>> cars.sort()\n>>> print(cars)\n\n['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']\n```\n\nwe can also pass the argument ```reverse=true``` to display the sorted list in reverse-alphabetical order.\n\n```\n>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n>>> cars.sort(reverse=true)\n>>> print(cars)\n\n['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi']\n```\n\n### sorting a list temporarily using the sorted() function \n\ninstead of using sort() which alters the original object, we can use sorted() which does not alter the original list. \n\n### printing a list in reverse order\n\nto reverse the original order of a list, you can use the reverse() method. this permanently changes the order of the list \n\n```\n>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n>>> cars.reverse()\n>>> print(cars)\n\n['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']\n```\n\n**notice** that reverse() doesn\u2019t sort backward alphabetically; it simply reverses the order of the list:\n\n### finding the length of a list \n\nyou can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function."

pairs\n- pg 6: accessing values with get()\n- pg 7: looping through all key-value pairs\n- pg 8: sets\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## dictioanries\n\na dictionary in python is a collection of key-value pairs. each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. a key\u2019s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. in fact, you can use any object that you can create in python as a value in a dictionary.\n\nin python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces\n\nconsider the following dictionary example: \n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n\n>>> print(alien_0['color'])\n>>> print(alien_0['points'])\n\ngreen\n5\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## accessing values in a dictionary\n\nto get the value associated with a key, give the name of the dictionary and then place the key inside a set of square brackets\n\nfor example: \n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}\n>>> print(alien_0['color'])\n\ngreen\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## adding new key-value pairs\n\ndictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary at any time. to add a new key-value pair, you would give the name of the dictionary followed by the new key in square brackets, along with the new value.\n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n>>> alien_0['x_position'] = 0\n>>> alien_0['y_position'] = 25\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25}\n```\n\ndictionaries retain the order in which they were defined. when you print a dictionary or loop through its elements, you will see the elements in the same order they were added to the dictionary.\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## removing key-value pairs\n\nwhen you no longer need a piece of information that\u2019s stored in a dictionary, you can use the del statement to completely remove a key-value pair. all del needs is the name of the dictionary and the key that you want to remove.\n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n>>> del alien_0['points']\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n{'color': 'green'}\n```\n\nnote that the deleted key-value pair is removed permanently\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## accessing elements using the get() method\n\nthe get() method requires a key as a first argument. as a second optional argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn\u2019t exist:\n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}\n\n>>> point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'no point value assigned.')\n>>> print(point_value)\n\nno point value assigned.\n```\n\nif there\u2019s a chance the key you\u2019re asking for might not exist, consider using the get() method instead of the square bracket notation.\n\n**note:** if you leave out the second argument in the call to get() and the key doesn\u2019t exist, python will return the value none, which means \u201cno value exists.\u201d\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## looping through all key-value pairs\n\nwe can use a for loop together with the .tems() method to iterate over all the keys and values from a dictionary \n\n```\n>>> user_0 = {\n        'username': 'efermi',\n        'first':

first\nvalue: enrico\n\nkey: last\nvalue: fermi\n```\n\n### looping through all the keys in a dictionary \n\nwe can then loop through just the keys from a dictionary by replacing the .tems() method with the .keys() method instead \n\n```\n>>> favorite_languages = {\n        'jen': 'python',\n        'sarah': 'c',\n        'edward': 'rust',\n        'phil': 'python',\n        }\n\n>>> for name in favorite_languages.keys():\n        print(name.title())\n\njen\nsarah\nedward\nphil\n```\n\n**note:** looping through keys is the default behaviour when looping through a dictionary so ```for name in favourite_languages``` would be the same. \n\nwe can also use the keys() method to find out if a particular person was polled based on the example above\n\n```\n>>> if 'erin' not in favorite_languages.keys():\n        print(\"erin, please take our poll!\")\n\nerin, please take our poll!\n```\n\n### looping through all values in a dictionary \n\njust like how we used .keys() to retrieve only the keys from a dictionary, we can use the same concept but for retrieving only values by using the .value() method. \n\n```\n>>> for language in favorite_languages.values():\n        print(language.title())\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## sets \n\nsets look like dictionaries because they are also enclosed in curly braces {}. however, unlike dictionaries and lists, sets do not retain the original order in which values were added to the set. additionally, sets do not allow duplicate values \n\n```\nmy_set = {'python', 'java', 'c#'}\n```\n\nsets support:\n- add()\n- remove()\n- discard()\n- clear()\n\nsets only allow immutable types to be stored: \n- int\n- float\n- str\n- tuple\n- frozenset"

unpacking positional arguments \n\nnormally, functions expect separate arguments:\n\n```\n>>> def add(a, b, c):\n        return a + b + c\n```\n\nyou must call it like:\n\n```\nadd(1,2,3)\n```\n\nbut what if your values are already in:\n- a list \u2192 [1, 2, 3]\n- or a dictionary \u2192 {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n\nwithout unpacking, this fails:\n\n```\nvalues = [1, 2, 3]\nadd(values)        # \u274c wrong \u2014 parameter 'a' gets the whole list\n```\n\nso python gives you unpacking operators:\n- '*' for sequences (list / tuple)\n- '**' for dictionaries\n\nthey \u201cspread\u201d the values into separate arguments.\n\n#### example using '*':\n\n```\n>>> def add(a, b, c):\n        print(a, b, c)\n\n>>> values = [10, 20, 30]\n>>> add(*values)\n```\n\ninternally, python turns this into \n\n```\nadd(10, 20, 30)\n```\n\n#### example using '**':\n\n```\ndef greet(name, age):\n    print(name, age)\n\ndata = {\"name\": \"brandon\", \"age\": 21}\ngreet(**data)\n```"

excessive functions\n- global variables\n- difficult to expand on\n\noop allows you to model your program as a collection of objects. when you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have \n\nwithout classes:\n- no objects\n- no encapsulation\n- no inheritence\n- no polymoprhism\n\nalthough we have not learnt the above yet, these form the 4 pillars of oop \n\n### what is an object? \n\nan object is a real instance that is created from a class \n\n### creating a simple class\n\n```\nclass dog:\n\n    # doc-string describing what the class does \n    \"\"\"a simple attempt to model a dog.\"\"\" \n\n     def __init__(self, name, age):\n        \"\"\"initialize name and age attributes.\"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n

in response to a command.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"{self.name} rolled over!\")\n```\n\nby convention, capitalized names refer to classes in python \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n### the __init__() method \n\na function that is part of a class is called a method. the ```__init__()``` method is a special method that python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the dog class. \n\nto understand the ```self``` paarmeter we can compre the difference between a class and a function. a function is also an object in python, however it is usually stateless by default which means when you reuse a function it has no memory of previous calls to it. however when we create an instance of a class the changes we make to that instance persist in memory and previous changes are remembered. now ```self``` does the follwoing:  \n\n- self = \u201cthis specific object\u201d\n- it allows methods to access and modify that object\u2019s own data\n\nthe following example showcases this distinction between using self and not using self\n\n```\nclass example:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.persistent = 0      # stored in the object (uses self)\n        temporary = 0           # local variable (no self) \u2014 useless here\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.persistent += 1    # modifies object state\n        temporary = 0           # local variable created fresh each call\n        temporary += 1\n\n        print(\"self.persistent =\", self.persistent)\n        print(\"temporary =\", temporary)\n```\n\nnow if we ran the following :\n\n```\ne = example()\n\ne.increment()\ne.increment()\ne.increment()\n```\n\nwe would get this out put: \n\n```\nself.persistent = 1\ntemporary = 1\n\nself.persistent = 2\ntemporary = 1\n\nself.persistent = 3\ntemporary = 1\n```\n\nany variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and we\u2019ll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class.\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## attributes\n\nthere are two types of attributes:\n- instance attributes\n    - these belong to each object separately  \n- class attributes\n    - these belong to the class itself, and are shared by all instances.\n\n\n```\nclass user:\n    total_users = 0   # class attribute\n\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        user.total_users += 1\n        self.name = name   # instance attribute\n```\n\n### default attribute values \n\nwe can use default attribute values similarily to how we used default paramter values in functions \n\n```\nclass user:\n    def __init__(self, username, active = true, role = 'user'):\n        self.username = username\n        self.active = active\n        self.role = role\n\nu1 = user(\"john\")\nu2 = user(\"alice\", role=\"admin\")\n\nprint(u2.role)\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## inheritance \n\ninheritance allows you to define new classes based on other versions of classes previously written. \n\nwhen one class inherits from another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class.\n\nthe original class is called the parent class (superclass), and the new class is the child class (subclass). the child class can inherit any or all of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it\u2019s also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.\n\nthe following is a simple example of a class inheriting the methods and attributes from another class \n\n```\nclass car:\n    \"\"\"a simple attempt to represent a car.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n        \"\"\"initialize attributes to describe a car.\"\"\"\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.odometer_reading = 0\n\n    def get_descriptive_name(self):\n        \"\"\"return a neatly formatted descriptive name.\"\"\"\n        long_name = f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\"\n        return long_name.title()\n\n    def read_odometer(self):\n        \"\"\"print a statement showing the car's mileage.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"this car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.\")\n\n    def update_odometer(self, mileage):\n        \"\"\"set the odometer reading to the given value.\"\"\"\n        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:\n            self.odometer_reading = mileage\n        else:\n            print(\"you can't roll back an odometer!\")\n\n    def increment_odometer(self, miles):\n        \"\"\"add the given amount to the odometer reading.\"\"\"\n        self.odometer_reading += miles\n\nclass electriccar(car):\n    \"\"\"represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n        \"\"\"initialize attributes of the parent class.\"\"\"\n        super().__init__(make, model, year)\n\n\n\u277a my_leaf = electriccar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)\nprint(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())\n```\n\n**note:** ```the super()``` function is a specialized function that allows you to call a method from the parent class. \n\nto inherit the properties from another class we simply input the parent class's name in the parentheses of the new child class we are creating \n\n**note:** when you inherit from another class, that child class automatically has access to all the parent class's methods and attributes \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## overriding methods from the parent class \n\nyou can override any method from the parent class that doesn\u2019t fit what you\u2019re trying to model with the child class. to do this, you define a method in the child class with the same name as the method you want to override in the parent class. python will disregard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method you define in the child class.\n\n```\nclass electriccar(car):\n    --snip--\n\n    def fill_gas_tank(self):\n        \"\"\"electric cars don't have gas tanks.\"\"\"\n        print(\"this car doesn't have a gas tank!\")\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## composition \n\ncomposition is when:\n- one class owns another class as part of itself\n- the relationship is: \u201chas a\u201d, not \u201cis a\u201d\n\n```\nclass car:\n     --snip--\n\nclass battery:\n     \"\"\"a simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car.\"\"\"\n\n     def __init__(self, battery_size=40):\n        \"\"\"initialize the battery's attributes.\"\"\"\n        self.battery_size = battery_size\n\n     def describe_battery(self):\n        \"\"\"print a statement describing the battery size.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"this car has a {self.battery_size}-kwh battery.\")\n\n\nclass electriccar(car):\n    \"\"\"represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n        \"\"\"\n        initialize attributes of the parent class.\n        then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__(make, model, year)\n        self.battery = battery()\n\nmy_leaf = electriccar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)\nprint(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())\nmy_leaf.battery.describe_battery()\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## importing classes \n\npython allows you to store classes in modules and then import the classes you need into your main program \n\nit is good practice to write a doc-string for each module you create \n\nto import a class from a module we can call the python file name and then import the class using the class name\n\nfor example:\n\n```\nfrom car import car\n```\n\n### importing an entire module\n\nwe can also import an entire module and then access the classes you need using dot notation. \n\n```\nimport car\n```\n\n### using aliases \n\nwhen importing from a module we can use an alias to shorten the keyword we need to enter in order to call the class \n\n```\nfrom electric_car import electriccar as ec\n```\n\n## terminology \n\n| term | meaning |\n|------|--------|\n| class | a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects |\n| object | a real instance created from a class |\n| method | a function that belongs to a class |\n| attribute | a variable that belongs to an object or a class |\n| instance attribute | an attribute that belongs to a specific object (each object has its own copy) |\n| class attribute | an attribute shared by all instances of a class |\n| constructor | the `__init__()` method that initializes a new object |\n| self | refers to the current object; used to access its attributes and methods |\n| inheritance | \u201cis a\u201d relationship (e.g., dog is an animal) |\n| parent / base class | the class being inherited from |\n| child / subclass | the class that inherits from another class |\n| super() | calls a method from the parent class, usually the constructor |\n| overriding | replacing a parent class method with a new version in the child class |\n| composition | \u201chas a\u201d relationship (e.g., car has an engine) |\n| component class | a class that is contained inside another class (used in composition) |\n| encapsulation | keeping data and behavior together and controlling access to them |\n| polymorphism | different objects responding differently to the same method name |\n| module | a python file that contains classes or functions |\n| import | bringing a class or module into another file so it can be used |\n| alias | a short alternative name given during import (e.g., `as ec`) |"

therefore, you can output any slice from the end of a list.\n\n```\n>>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n>>> print(players[-3:])\n\n['michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n```\n\n### looping through a slice \n\n```\n>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, ,5 ,6]\n\n>>> for number in numbers[-3:]:\n>>>     print(number)\n\n4\n5\n6\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## copying a list\n\nto copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]). this tells python to make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, producing a copy of the entire list.\n\n```\n>>> favourite_foods = ['apple', 'grape', 'watermelon']\n>>> fruits = favourite_foods[:]\n\n>>> print(fruits)\n\n['apple', 'grape', 'watermelon']\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## tuples\n\nsometimes you\u2019ll want to create a list of items that cannot change. tuples allow you to do just that. python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable list is called a tuple.\n\na tuple looks just like a list, except you use parentheses instead of square brackets. once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by using each item\u2019s index, just as you would for a list.\n\nfor example, if we have a rectangle that should always be a certain size, we can ensure that its size doesn\u2019t change by putting the dimensions into a tuple:\n\n```\n>>> dimensions = (200, 50)\n>>> print(dimensions[0])\n>>> print(dimensions[1])\n\n200\n50\n```\n\n\nnow if we try to change one of the items from a tuple: \n\n```\n>>> dimensions = (200, 50)\n>>> dimensions[0] = 250\n\ntraceback (most recent call last):\n  file \"dimensions.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    dimensions[0] = 250\ntypeerror: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n```\n\n**note:** tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them look neater and more readable. if you want to define a tuple with one element, you need to include a trailing comma:\n\n```my_t = (3,)```"

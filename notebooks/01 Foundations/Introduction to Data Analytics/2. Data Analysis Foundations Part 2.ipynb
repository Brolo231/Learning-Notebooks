    "# **Part 2: Deepening Your Data Analysis Foundations**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section expands on further concepts from part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Data Quality & Data Integrity**\n",
    "High-quality data is the foundation of reliable analytics. Poor data leads to incorrect insights, weak models, and bad business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Dimensions of Data Quality**\n",
    "- **Accuracy** – Is the data correct and error-free?\n",
    "- **Completeness** – Are all required fields and records present?\n",
    "- **Consistency** – Does the data agree across systems and time?\n",
    "- **Validity** – Does the data follow rules (formats, ranges, types)?\n",
    "- **Uniqueness** – No duplicates where there should be unique records.\n",
    "- **Timeliness** – Is the data up-to-date and relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why It Matters**\n",
    "- Bad data → misleading insights\n",
    "- Incorrect metrics → poor decision-making\n",
    "- Models fail → financial or operational risk increases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Introduction to Databases & SQL Foundations**\n",
    "Most real-world data lives in databases. SQL is the main tool used to extract and manipulate it.\n",

    "### **Relational Database Basics**\n",
    "- **Tables** – store data in rows and columns.\n",
    "- **Rows** – individual records.\n",
    "- **Columns** – attributes or fields.\n",
    "- **Primary Key** – a unique identifier for each record.\n",
    "- **Foreign Key** – links between tables.\n",
    "- **Relationships** – how tables connect (one-to-many, many-to-many).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Essential SQL Skills**\n",
    "- SELECT → choose columns\n",
    "- WHERE → filter rows\n",
    "- ORDER BY → sort results\n",
    "- GROUP BY → aggregate data\n",
    "- JOIN → combine multiple tables\n",
    "- COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX → summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why SQL Matters**\n",
    "- Analysts frequently query large datasets\n",
    "- Required for dashboards, reporting, and machine learning pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Core Statistical Foundations**\n",

    "- Sampling\n",
    "- Confidence intervals\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing\n",
    "- p-values\n",

    "### **Why It Matters**\n",
    "- Helps interpret data correctly\n",
    "- Avoids false conclusions\n",
    "- Supports predictive modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Data Ethics, Privacy & Governance**\n",
    "Modern analysts must work responsibly, especially with personal or sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** – name, ID number, address, email\n",
    "- **Data minimization** – only collect what is necessary\n",
    "- **Consent & compliance** – POPIA (SA), GDPR (EU)\n",
    "- **Bias & fairness** – avoid discriminatory algorithms\n",
    "- **Transparency** – explainable insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why It Matters**\n",
    "- Protects users\n",
    "- Prevents legal issues\n",
    "- Ensures trustworthy data-driven decisions\n",

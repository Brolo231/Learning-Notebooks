    "# Numerical Data vs Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What Does “Type of Data” Mean?\n",
    "A **data type** describes **what kind of information a variable represents** and **what you are allowed to do with it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "- Can you calculate with it?\n",
    "- Can you order it?\n",
    "- Is it just a label?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why distinguishing between **numerical** and **categorical** data is so important.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Numerical Data (Quantitative Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "**Numerical data** represents values that can be **measured or counted** and expressed as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values have **real numeric meaning**, not just labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Represents **quantity**\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations are meaningful\n",
    "- Can be analysed using statistical formulas\n",
    "- Supports mathematical comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "- Age (18, 25, 42)\n",
    "- Height (170 cm, 185 cm)\n",
    "- Income (R12 000)\n",
    "- Number of purchases (3, 10)\n",
    "- Exam score (78%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Numerical Data\n",
    "#### a) Discrete Numerical Data\n",
    "- Countable values\n",
    "- Whole numbers only  \n",
    "Examples: number of customers, number of items sold\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Continuous Numerical Data\n",
    "- Measured values\n",
    "- Can have decimals  \n",
    "Examples: weight, temperature, time\n",
    "\n",
    "### What It Means in Practice\n",
    "Because numerical data has magnitude:\n",
    "- You can calculate averages and totals\n",
    "- You can measure differences\n",
    "- You can use regression, correlations, and forecasts\n",

    "## 3. Categorical Data (Qualitative Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "**Categorical data** represents **qualities or characteristics**, not measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers (if used) act only as **labels**, not values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Represents **groups or categories**\n",
    "- Arithmetic makes no logical sense\n",
    "- Focuses on classification, not calculation\n",
    "- Often analysed using counts and proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "- Gender (Male, Female)\n",
    "- Product type (Laptop, Phone, Tablet)\n",
    "- Payment method (Card, Cash)\n",
    "- Customer segment (Student, Professional)\n",
    "- Country (South Africa, UK)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠ Important: Even if categories are coded with numbers (e.g., Male = 1, Female = 2), they are **not numerical values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Categorical Data\n",
    "#### a) Nominal Data\n",
    "- Categories with **no order**\n",
    "Examples: blood type, eye colour, country\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Ordinal Data\n",
    "- Categories with a **logical order**\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Education level (High School → Degree → Masters)\n",
    "- Satisfaction (Low → Medium → High)\n",

    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Numerical Data | Categorical Data |\n",
    "|------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Represents | Quantity | Group or label |\n",
    "| Arithmetic allowed | Yes | No |\n",
    "| Can be averaged | Yes | No |\n",
    "| Ordering | Yes | Sometimes |\n",
    "| Examples | Age, income | Gender, category |\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Why This Difference Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the difference tells you:\n",
    "- **how to process the data**\n",
    "- **which analysis techniques to use**\n",
    "- **which visualizations make sense**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Numerical → averages, regression, line charts\n",
    "- Categorical → counts, proportions, bar charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the wrong type leads to **incorrect analysis and misleading results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. In Simple Terms\n",
    "- **Numerical data answers “How much?” or “How many?”**\n",
    "- **Categorical data answers “Which type?” or “Which group?”**\n",

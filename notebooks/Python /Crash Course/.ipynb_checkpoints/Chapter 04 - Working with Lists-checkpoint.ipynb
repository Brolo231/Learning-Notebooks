    "## Looping through an entire list\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a ```for``` loop to iterate through all elements in a list. Looping is important because it automates repetitive tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> cars = [\"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\"]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> for car in cars:\n",
    ">>>     print(car)\n",

    "### range()\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are ideal for storing sets of numbers, and Python provides a variety of tools to help you work efficiently with lists of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s ```range()``` function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers. For example, you can use the range() function to print a series of numbers like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> for value in range(1, 5):\n",
    ">>>    print(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### using range() to make a list of Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = list(range(1,6))\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also pass a thrid argument to ```range()``` which will tell python to use that value as a step in generating the numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "For Example, the following creates a list of even numbers: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))\n",
    ">>> print(even_numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple statistics with a List of Numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "A few Python functions are helpful when working with lists of numbers. For example, you can easily find the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]\n",
    ">>> min(digits)\n",
    "0\n",
    ">>> max(digits)\n",
    "9\n",
    ">>> sum(digits)\n",
    "45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## List comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A list comprehension combines the for loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically appends each new element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following list comprehension generateas a list contasining square numbers 1-10\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]\n",
    ">>> print(squares)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this syntax, begin with a descriptive name for the list, such as squares. Next, open a set of square brackets and define the expression for the values you want to store in the new list. In this example the expression is value**2, which raises the value to the second power. Then, write a for loop to generate the numbers you want to feed into the expression, and close the square brackets. The for loop in this example is for value in range(1, 11), which feeds the values 1 through 10 into the expression value**2. Note that no colon is used at the end of the for statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add condtionals to list comprehensions in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows inline conditional expressions (also called a ternary expression):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "value_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with part of a list \n",
    "\n",
    "A slice, in python, refers to working with a specific group of items from a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicing a List \n",
    "\n",
    "To slice a list we need to specify two indexes. The first is where the slice starts (this value is included in the slice), the second index is where we want the slice to end (excluding this value in the slice) \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n",
    ">>> print(players[0:3])\n",
    "\n",
    "['charles', 'martina', 'michael']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you omit the first index, python starts the slice at the beginning of the list, the same principle applies with a slice unitl the end of the list \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a negative index returns an element a certain distance from the end of a list; therefore, you can output any slice from the end of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n",
    ">>> print(players[-3:])\n",
    "\n",
    "['michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping through a slice \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, ,5 ,6]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> for number in numbers[-3:]:\n",
    ">>>     print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Copying a List\n",
    "\n",
    "To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]). This tells Python to make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, producing a copy of the entire list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> favourite_foods = ['apple', 'grape', 'watermelon']\n",
    ">>> fruits = favourite_foods[:]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(fruits)\n",
    "\n",
    "['apple', 'grape', 'watermelon']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you’ll want to create a list of items that cannot change. Tuples allow you to do just that. Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable list is called a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple looks just like a list, except you use parentheses instead of square brackets. Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by using each item’s index, just as you would for a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a rectangle that should always be a certain size, we can ensure that its size doesn’t change by putting the dimensions into a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> dimensions = (200, 50)\n",
    ">>> print(dimensions[0])\n",
    ">>> print(dimensions[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "200\n",
    "50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we try to change one of the items from a tuple: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> dimensions = (200, 50)\n",
    ">>> dimensions[0] = 250\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"dimensions.py\", line 2, in <module>\n",
    "    dimensions[0] = 250\n",
    "TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with one element, you need to include a trailing comma:\n",
    "\n",
    "```my_t = (3,)```"

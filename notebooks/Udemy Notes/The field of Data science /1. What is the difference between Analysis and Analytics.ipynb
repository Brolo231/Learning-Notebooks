    "\n",
    "Analysis involves breaking a large dataset into smaller, manageable parts and examining each section individually — as well as understanding how these parts relate to one another.  \n",
    "It focuses on **past events**, aiming to explain **how** or **why** something happened.\n",

    "## **Analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytics focuses on exploring **future possibilities**.  \n",
    "It applies logical, statistical, and computational techniques to the components obtained from analysis, searching for patterns and insights that help predict or guide future decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytics includes two main branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qualitative Analytics** → intuition + analysis  \n",
    "- **Quantitative Analytics** → formulas + algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "- *“Based on customer trends, sales are likely to increase next month if we launch a discount.”* \\\n",
    "- Why is this an example of Analytics? ⤵️ \\\n",
    "\t•\tCustomer trends → existing data pattern \\\n",

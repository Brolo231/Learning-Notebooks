    "\n",
    "#### Data modelling is the first step in database design.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a high-level, abstract phase (conceptual design) where the goal is to describe:\n",
    "- The data in the database (e.g., students, lecturers, courses).\n",
    "- The relationships between data (e.g., lecturers teach courses).\n",
    "- The constraints on the data (e.g., student numbers have 8 digits).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a conceptual representation of the database that ensures all user requirements are captured before implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in Database Design\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Modelling – Defines entities, relationships, and constraints conceptually.\n",
    "2. Logical Design – Converts the conceptual model into a DBMS-specific structure.\n",
    "3. Physical Design – Defines how data is actually stored, organized, and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step moves from abstract (conceptual) to detailed (physical).\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database design progresses through four abstraction levels, from most general to most specific:\n",

    "| **External Model** | The user’s view of the database | - Represents individual department views (e.g., HR vs Sales)<br>- Each department has its own external schema |\n",
    "| **Conceptual Model** | The overall community view | - Shows the logical structure of the entire database<br>- Includes entities, relationships, constraints, and business rules<br>- Independent of hardware and DBMS |\n",
    "| **Internal Model** | The database as seen by the DBMS | - Maps the conceptual model into DBMS structures<br>- Includes tables, keys, and constraints<br>- Examples: Relational, Network, Hierarchical models |\n",
    "| **Physical Model** | The actual storage structure | - Focuses on performance, storage, and access methods<br>- Defines how data is stored on disk (e.g., indexing, compression, encryption) |\n",

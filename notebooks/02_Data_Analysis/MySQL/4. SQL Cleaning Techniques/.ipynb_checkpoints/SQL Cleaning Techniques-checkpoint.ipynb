    "# üîç Why Data Cleaning Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before diving into SQL‚Äôs prowess, let‚Äôs understand why data cleaning is non-negotiable:\n",
    "\n",
    "**üéØ Accuracy:** Clean data ensures that analyses are based on correct information, leading to valid conclusions. \\\n",
    "**‚ö° Efficiency:** It reduces processing time, making data workflows smoother and faster. \\\n",
    "**üí° Decision-Making:** Reliable data drives better strategic decisions, minimizing risks and maximizing opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Best Practices for Data Cleaning with SQL\n",
    "1. üîê Back Up Your Data: Always work on a copy to prevent accidental data loss.\n",
    "2. üóíÔ∏è Document Changes: Keep a log of all cleaning steps for reproducibility.\n",
    "3. üîÑ Iterative Cleaning: Data cleaning is rarely a one-time process; continuously refine your data.\n",
    "4. ü§ñ Automate with Scripts: Use stored procedures and scripts to automate repetitive cleaning tasks.\n",
    "5. üìà Monitor Data Quality: Set up real-time dashboards to track data health.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. üóëÔ∏è Removing Duplicates\n",
    "Duplicate records can distort analysis. Using ROW_NUMBER() or DISTINCT, SQL effortlessly identifies and eliminates these redundancies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH RankedData AS (\n",
    "  SELECT *, \n",
    "  ROW_NUMBER() OVER \n",
    "          (PARTITION BY column_to_check_duplicates ORDER BY id) AS rn\n",
    "  FROM your_table\n",
    ")\n",
    "DELETE FROM RankedData WHERE rn > 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.‚ùì Handling Missing Values\n",
    "Missing data can skew results. SQL offers strategies like imputation or deletion:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üö´ Removing Rows with NULLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM your_table \n",
    "    WHERE column_with_missing IS NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr style=\"width: 50%; margin: auto;\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üßÆ Imputation with Average:\n",
    "**COALESCE temporarily fills NULL values during a query without modifying the table.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column_with_missing, \n",
    "       COALESCE(column_with_missing, \n",
    "                ROUND((SELECT AVG(column_with_missing) \n",
    "                       FROM your_table \n",
    "                       WHERE column_with_missing IS NOT NULL), 2)) \n",
    "       AS filled_value\n",
    "FROM your_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr style=\"width: 50%; margin: auto;\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UPDATE permanently replaces NULL values with the column‚Äôs average.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE your_table\n",
    "SET column_with_missing = (\n",
    "  SELECT AVG(column_with_missing)\n",
    "  FROM your_table\n",
    "  WHERE column_with_missing IS NOT NULL\n",
    ")\n",
    "WHERE column_with_missing IS NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. üî§ Standardizing Data Formats\n",
    "Inconsistent data formats can be problematic. SQL functions like UPPER(), LOWER(), TRIM(), and CAST() help standardize data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE your_table\n",
    "SET name_column = UPPER(TRIM(name_column));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. üìù Correcting Inaccurate Data\n",
    "Using CASE WHEN statements, SQL allows conditional updates to rectify incorrect entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE your_table\n",
    "SET status = CASE\n",
    "  WHEN status = 'Actve' THEN 'Active'\n",
    "  WHEN status = 'Inactve' THEN 'Inactive'\n",
    "  ELSE status\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.üîí Validating Data Integrity\n",
    "SQL constraints (like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and UNIQUE) enforce data validity right at the database level, preventing dirty data from entering in the first place üöß.\n",

    "### üîÑ Pivoting and Unpivoting Data: Transform datasets for better analysis using PIVOT and UNPIVOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "  SELECT department, month, revenue\n",
    "  FROM sales_data\n",
    ") AS SourceTable\n",

    "       LAG(sales, 1) OVER \n",
    "                  (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY date) AS Previous_Sales\n",

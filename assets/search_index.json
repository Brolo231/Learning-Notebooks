Once Python receives the user\u2019s input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with.\n\n```\n>>> message = input(\"Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: \")\n>>> print(message)\n\n\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: Hello everyone!\nHello everyone!\n```\n\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll want to write a prompt that\u2019s longer than one line. We can acheive this through the use of the += operator:\n\n```\n>>> prompt = \"If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\"\n>>> prompt += \"\\nWhat is your first name? \"\n\n>>> name = input(prompt)\n>>> print(f\"\\nHello, {name}!\")\n\nIf you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\nWhat is your first name? Eric\n\nHello, Eric!\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Using int() to accept numerical input \n\nSometimes we will want user input in a numerical format, for example, age. By default input() stores user input as a string, therefore, we can use int() to convert user input to type int\n\n```\n>>> age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n\nHow old are you? 21\n\n>>> age\n\n21\n\n>>> age > 18\n\nTrue\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## The modulo operator \n\nA useful tool for working with numerical information is the modulo operator (%), which divides one number by another number and returns the remainder:\n\n```\n>>> 4 % 3\n1\n>>> 5 % 3\n2\n>>> 6 % 3\n0\n>>> 7 % 3\n1\n```\n\nWe can use this logic to determine if a number is even or if it is odd. When ```if number % 2 is equal to 0``` then 'number' is even \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Introducing while loops\n\nThe while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition is true.\n\n```\n>>> num = 1\n>>> while num <= 5:\n        print(num)\n        num += 1\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\n### Letting the user choose when to quit the while loop \n\n```\n>>> message = \"\"\n>>> while message != 'quit':\n        message = input(\"type 'quit' to quit: \")\n        print(f\"You typed: {message}\")\n\ntype 'quit' to quit: quit\nYou typed: quit\n```\n\n### Using break to Exit a loop\n\n```\nnum = 5\n>>> while True:\n        print(num)\n        num += 1\n        if num >= 10:\n            break\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n```\n\n### Using continue in a Loop\n\nRather than breaking out of a loop entirely without executing the rest of its code, you can use the continue statement to return to the beginning of the loop, based on the result of a conditional test. For example, consider a loop that counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range:\n\n```\ncurrent_number = 0\n>>> while current_number < 10:\n        current_number += 1\n        if current_number % 2 == 0:\n           continue\n\n        print(current_number)\n\n\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n```\n\nIf a while loop continues forever press CTRL-C to stop the program from running\n\n### Removing all instances of specific values from a List \n\nSay you have a list of pets with the value 'cat' repeated several times. To remove all instances of that value, you can run a while loop until 'cat' is no longer in the list, as shown here:\n\n```\n>>> pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']\n>>> print(pets)\n\n>>> while 'cat' in pets:\n>>>     pets.remove('cat')\n\n>>> print(pets)\n```"

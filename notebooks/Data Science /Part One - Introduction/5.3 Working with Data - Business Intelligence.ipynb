    "Business Intelligence (BI) focuses on **transforming processed data into meaningful information** that explains **past and current business performance** and supports **data-driven decision-making**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional data processing or big data analytics, BI is primarily concerned with **descriptive and diagnostic analytics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: lightgreen;\">Processed Data → Analysis → Insights → Business Decisions</span>\n",

    "## **1. Purpose of Business Intelligence**\n",
    "\n",
    "After data has been pre-processed, BI techniques combine:\n",
    "- **business knowledge**\n",
    "- **data analysis skills**\n",
    "\n",
    "to answer questions such as:\n",
    "- What happened?\n",
    "- When did it happen?\n",
    "- How many units did we sell?\n",
    "- Which region performed best?\n",
    "- How does performance compare to targets?\n",
    "\n",
    "BI is mainly **backward-looking** (historical analysis), but highly valuable for management.\n",

    "## **2. Measuring Business Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Measurement Flow**\n",
    "**Observations → Quantification → Measures → Metrics → KPIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured flow is essential and is central to BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Observations**\n",
    "Observations are **raw business events or variables**, such as:\n",
    "- sales transactions\n",
    "- customer sign-ups\n",
    "- product returns\n",
    "- website visits\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations **cannot yet be analysed mathematically** in their raw form.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Quantification**\n",
    "**Quantification** is the process of converting observations into numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- counting number of sales\n",
    "- summing revenue\n",
    "- calculating averages\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantification makes analysis possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Measures**\n",
    "**Measures** are the accumulated or aggregated results of quantified observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "- Based on historical data\n",
    "- Often simple descriptive statistics\n",
    "- Stored in fact tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- total monthly sales\n",
    "- average order value\n",
    "- number of new customers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 Metrics**\n",
    "**Metric = Measure + Business Meaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "A metric gives context to a measure so it becomes meaningful to the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- monthly sales growth rate\n",
    "- customer churn rate\n",
    "- revenue per region\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics allow comparison across:\n",
    "- time periods\n",
    "- regions\n",
    "- products\n",
    "- departments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.5 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**\n",
    "**KPI = Metric + Business Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "KPIs are **strategic**, goal-oriented metrics that indicate whether the business is succeeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- sales growth ≥ 10%\n",
    "- customer retention ≥ 85%\n",
    "- order fulfilment time ≤ 48 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "KPIs are:\n",
    "- limited in number\n",
    "- aligned to strategy\n",
    "- monitored regularly\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Data Aggregation**\n",
    "Combining large volumes of processed data into:\n",
    "- daily\n",
    "- weekly\n",
    "- monthly\n",
    "- yearly summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables trend analysis and performance monitoring.\n",

    "### ✅ **Dimensional Analysis**\n",
    "Analysing measures across dimensions such as:\n",
    "- time\n",
    "- product\n",
    "- region\n",
    "- customer segment\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables:\n",
    "- drill-down (high-level → detail)\n",
    "- roll-up (detail → summary)\n",
    "- slicing and dicing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Comparative Analysis**\n",
    "Comparing performance:\n",
    "- against previous periods\n",
    "- against targets\n",

    "- storytelling with data\n",
    "- visualisation best practices\n",
    "- executive summaries\n",
    "\n",

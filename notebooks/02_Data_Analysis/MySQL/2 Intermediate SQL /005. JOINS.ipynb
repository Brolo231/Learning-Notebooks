    "\n",
    "A **LEFT JOIN** is going to take everything from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table, and return any matches from the right table. Vice versa for **RIGHT JOIN**\n",

    "**Note:** Previously we did an INNER JOIN on these tables (only returning rows with matching employee_id in both tables) and noticed that ron swanson was excluded from the output because he did not have an employee_id in both tables.

    "- The join condition: for each row in sal1, find the row in sal2 whose employee_id equals sal1.employee_id + 1.\n",
    "- Practically, that pairs id 1 → 2, 2 → 3, etc. If there is no employee_id exactly one greater, that sal1 row is excluded (because it’s an inner join).\n",

    "```SELECT sal1.first_name AS secret_santa,```\\\n",

    "```;```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** From the explanation of line 9 above if we had ON sal1.employee_id <strong><span style=\"color: red;\">-</span></strong> 1 = sal2.employee_id instead of '+' then we would need to match values from the right table to the left table where employee_id - 1 = left.employee_id \n",
    "since the first value is 1 in employee_id there is no emoloyee_id with 0 so therefore it is skipped. 2 - 1 = 1 however so employee_id with value 2 will match with employee_id with 1\n",

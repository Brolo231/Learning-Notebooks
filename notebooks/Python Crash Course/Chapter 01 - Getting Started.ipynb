    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Running python in a terminal session \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by opening up a command window / terminal and type: `python`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will show the currrent version of python installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Terminal shortcuts (macos): \n",
    "- ctrl + L = Clear Python Terminal \n",
    "- ctrl + D = Leave python prompt and return to terminal prompt\n",

    "### Useful Terminal commands (macos):\n",
    "- cd (by itself) = is used to go to the home directory \n",
    "- cd .. = is used to naviagte around directories where .. represents directory names\n",
    "- cd - = is used to go back to the previous directory \n",
    "- pwd = print working directory shows the path to the current directory\n",
    "- ls = represents list, which shows all nonhidden files that exist in the current directory\n",

    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.  \\\n",
    "For instance, you can call a variable: \\\n",
    "✅ ```message_1``` \\\n",
    "but not \\\n",
    "❌ ```1_message.```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ variable references -> object (value) \\\n",
    "❌ variables do not store values \n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types \n",
    "Because most programs define and gather some sort of data and then do something useful with it, it helps to classify different types of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "A string is a series of characters. Anything placed within single or double quotes in python is a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful String Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- title()\n",
    "- upper()\n",
    "- lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "When storing data it is useful to store it using lower(), as user data is not trustworthy when it comes to capitalization\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python f-strings\n",
    "    \n",
    "f-strings (f stands for format) allow variables to be passed within strings with which python replaces the variable with the object / value associated with that variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding whitespae to strings with Tabs and Newlines\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a tab to text we can use the following character combination: `\\t`\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a newline we can use the following character combination: `\\n`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stripping whitespace in python\n",
    "\n",
    "We can either strip whitespace to the left of a string. the right, or all the whitespace. \n",
    "\n",
    "- lstrip()\n",
    "- rstrip()\n",
    "- strip()\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above string methods do not alter the variables object in place. To alter the variables object we need to asign the variable to the updated value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g. \\\n",
    "`x = x.strip()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing Prefixes and suffixes\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the following methods: `removeprefix(prefix_to_remove_from_string)` \\\n",
    "`removesuffix(...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, just like how strip() does not alter the object associated with the variable that we apply these methods to, the same principle applies with removeprefix(). \n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers \n",
    "You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 2 + 3\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>> 3 - 2\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> 2 * 3\n",
    "6\n",
    ">>> 3 / 2\n",
    "1.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 3 ** 2\n",
    "9\n",
    ">>> 3 ** 3\n",
    "27\n",
    ">>> 10 ** 6\n",
    "1000000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order you specify. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 2 + 3*4\n",
    "14\n",
    ">>> (2 + 3) * 4\n",
    "20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### floats \n",
    "Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can appear at any position in a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part floats can be treated as normal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 0.1 + 0.1\n",
    "0.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 0.2 + 0.1\n",
    "0.30000000000000004\n",
    ">>> 3 * 0.1\n",
    "0.30000000000000004\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python tries to find a way to represent the result as precisely as possible, which is sometimes difficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underscores in Numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores to make large numbers more readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> universe_age = 14_000_000_000\n",
    ">>> universe_age\n",
    "14000000000 # Notice how python only prints the digits\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants \n",
    "\n",
    "A constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program. Python doesn’t have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000\n",
    "```\n"

    "## 📋 What is a List? \n",
    "\n",
    "- A list is a collection of items in a particular order\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ask Python to print a list, Python returns its representation of the list, including the square brackets: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\n",
    ">>> print(bicycles) \n",
    "['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Elements in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired\n",
    "- To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🅾️ -> 1️⃣ Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1. This is true of most programming languages, and the reason has to do with how the list operations are implemented at a lower level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‒1️⃣ Negative index values \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. If you ask for the item at index ```-1```, Python always returns the last item in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "-This convention extends to other negative index values as well. The index -2 returns the second item from the end of the list, the index -3 returns the third item from the end, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying Elements in a List \n",
    "\n",
    "- To change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appending elements to a list \n",
    "\n",
    "- When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> x = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> x.append('d')\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inserting elements into a list\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() method. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the value of the new item:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n",
    ">>> motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati)\n",
    ">>> print(motorcycles)\n",
    "['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing elements from a list \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can use the del statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n",
    ">>> print(motorcycles)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> del motorcycles[0]\n",
    ">>> print(motorcycles)\n",
    "['yamaha', 'suzuki']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### removing an item using the pop() method\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it unlike the del statement\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n",
    ">>> print(motorcycles)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()\n",
    ">>> print(motorcycles)\n",
    ">>> print(popped_motorcycle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing an item by value\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']\n",
    ">>> print(motorcycles)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> motorcycles.remove('ducati')\n",
    ">>> print(motorcycles)\n",
    "\n",
    "['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```remove()``` method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there’s a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you’ll need to use a loop to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organizing a list\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to present information in a particular order. Python provides a number of different ways to organize lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorting a list permanently with the sort() method\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use sort() to sort items alphabetically or reverse-alphabetical order. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n",
    ">>> cars.sort()\n",
    ">>> print(cars)\n",
    "\n",
    "['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also pass the argument ```reverse=True``` to display the sorted list in reverse-alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n",
    ">>> cars.sort(reverse=True)\n",
    ">>> print(cars)\n",
    "\n",
    "['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorting a list temporarily using the sorted() function \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using sort() which alters the original object, we can use sorted() which does not alter the original list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Printing a list in Reverse Order\n",
    "\n",
    "To reverse the original order of a list, you can use the reverse() method. This permanently changes the order of the list \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n",
    ">>> cars.reverse()\n",
    ">>> print(cars)\n",
    "\n",
    "['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice** that reverse() doesn’t sort backward alphabetically; it simply reverses the order of the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the length of a list \n",
    "\n",
    "You can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function."

    "## How the input() function works\n",
    "\n",
    "The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text. Once Python receives the user’s input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> message = input(\"Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: \")\n",
    ">>> print(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: Hello everyone!\n",
    "Hello everyone!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you’ll want to write a prompt that’s longer than one line. We can acheive this through the use of the += operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> prompt = \"If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\"\n",
    ">>> prompt += \"\\nWhat is your first name? \"\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> name = input(prompt)\n",
    ">>> print(f\"\\nHello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\n",
    "What is your first name? Eric\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, Eric!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using int() to accept numerical input \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we will want user input in a numerical format, for example, age. By default input() stores user input as a string, therefore, we can use int() to convert user input to type int\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "How old are you? 21\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> age\n",
    "\n",
    "21\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> age > 18\n",
    "\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The modulo operator \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful tool for working with numerical information is the modulo operator (%), which divides one number by another number and returns the remainder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 4 % 3\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> 5 % 3\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>> 6 % 3\n",
    "0\n",
    ">>> 7 % 3\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this logic to determine if a number is even or if it is odd. When ```if number % 2 is equal to 0``` then 'number' is even \n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing while loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> num = 1\n",
    ">>> while num <= 5:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "        num += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Letting the user choose when to quit the while loop \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> message = \"\"\n",
    ">>> while message != 'quit':\n",
    "        message = input(\"type 'quit' to quit: \")\n",
    "        print(f\"You typed: {message}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "type 'quit' to quit: quit\n",
    "You typed: quit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using break to Exit a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    ">>> while True:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "        num += 1\n",
    "        if num >= 10:\n",
    "            break\n",
    "\n",
    "5\n",
    "6\n",
    "7\n",
    "8\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using continue in a Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than breaking out of a loop entirely without executing the rest of its code, you can use the continue statement to return to the beginning of the loop, based on the result of a conditional test. For example, consider a loop that counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "current_number = 0\n",
    ">>> while current_number < 10:\n",
    "        current_number += 1\n",
    "        if current_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "           continue\n",
    "\n",
    "        print(current_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a while loop continues forever press CTRL-C to stop the program from running\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing all instances of specific values from a List \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a list of pets with the value 'cat' repeated several times. To remove all instances of that value, you can run a while loop until 'cat' is no longer in the list, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']\n",
    ">>> print(pets)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> while 'cat' in pets:\n",
    ">>>     pets.remove('cat')\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(pets)\n",
    "```"

    "## OOP (Object Oriented Programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before OOP, programs were mostly:\n",
    "- long scripts\n",
    "- excessive functions\n",
    "- global variables\n",
    "- difficult to expand on\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP allows you to model your program as a collection of objects. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have \n",
    "\n",
    "Without classes:\n",
    "- no objects\n",
    "- no encapsulation\n",
    "- no inheritence\n",
    "- no polymoprhism\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have not learnt the above yet, these form the 4 pillars of OOP \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an object? \n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a real instance that is created from a class \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a simple class\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # doc-string describing what the class does \n",
    "    \"\"\"A simple attempt to model a dog.\"\"\" \n",
    "\n",
    "     def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Initialize name and age attributes.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "     def sit(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command.\"\"\"\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} is now sitting.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     def roll_over(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Simulate rolling over in response to a command.\"\"\"\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} rolled over!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, capitalized names refer to classes in python \n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The __init__() method \n",
    "\n",
    "A function that is part of a class is called a method. The ```__init__()``` method is a special method that python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the Dog class. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the ```self``` paarmeter we can compre the difference between a class and a function. A function is also an object in python, however it is usually stateless by default which means when you reuse a function it has no memory of previous calls to it. However when we create an instance of a class the changes we make to that instance persist in memory and previous changes are remembered. Now ```self``` does the follwoing:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- self = “this specific object”\n",
    "- It allows methods to access and modify that object’s own data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example showcases this distinction between using self and not using self\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.persistent = 0      # stored in the object (uses self)\n",
    "        temporary = 0           # local variable (NO self) — useless here\n",
    "\n",
    "    def increment(self):\n",
    "        self.persistent += 1    # modifies object state\n",
    "        temporary = 0           # local variable created fresh each call\n",
    "        temporary += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        print(\"self.persistent =\", self.persistent)\n",
    "        print(\"temporary =\", temporary)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we ran the following :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "e = Example()\n",
    "\n",
    "e.increment()\n",
    "e.increment()\n",
    "e.increment()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We would get this out put: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "self.persistent = 1\n",
    "temporary = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "self.persistent = 2\n",
    "temporary = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "self.persistent = 3\n",
    "temporary = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and we’ll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of attributes:\n",
    "- Instance attributes\n",
    "    - These belong to each object separately  \n",
    "- Class attributes\n",
    "    - These belong to the class itself, and are shared by all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "    total_users = 0   # class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        User.total_users += 1\n",
    "        self.name = name   # instance attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default attribute values \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use default attribute values similarily to how we used default paramter values in functions \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, username, active = True, role = 'user'):\n",
    "        self.username = username\n",
    "        self.active = active\n",
    "        self.role = role\n",
    "\n",
    "u1 = User(\"john\")\n",
    "u2 = User(\"alice\", role=\"admin\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(u2.role)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Inheritance \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to define new classes based on other versions of classes previously written. \n",
    "\n",
    "When one class inherits from another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original class is called the parent class (superclass), and the new class is the child class (subclass). The child class can inherit any or all of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it’s also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a simple example of a class inheriting the methods and attributes from another class \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    \"\"\"A simple attempt to represent a car.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Initialize attributes to describe a car.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.odometer_reading = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_descriptive_name(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Return a neatly formatted descriptive name.\"\"\"\n",
    "        long_name = f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\"\n",
    "        return long_name.title()\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    def update_odometer(self, mileage):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Set the odometer reading to the given value.\"\"\"\n",
    "        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:\n",
    "            self.odometer_reading = mileage\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"You can't roll back an odometer!\")\n",

    "print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** ```The super()``` function is a specialized function that allows you to call a method from the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "To inherit the properties from another class we simply input the parent class's name in the parentheses of the new child class we are creating \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** When you inherit from another class, that child class automatically has access to all the parent class's methods and attributes \n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overriding methods from the parent class \n",
    "\n",
    "You can override any method from the parent class that doesn’t fit what you’re trying to model with the child class. To do this, you define a method in the child class with the same name as the method you want to override in the parent class. Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method you define in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Importing classes \n",
    "\n",

    "It is good practice to write a doc-string for each module you create \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "from car import Car\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Importing an Entire Module\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also import an entire module and then access the classes you need using dot notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import car\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using aliases \n",
    "\n",
    "When importing from a module we can use an alias to shorten the keyword we need to enter in order to call the class \n",

    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to **connect to a MySQL database**, run a **SQL query**, and display the results in a well-formatted table in Jupyter.

    "\n",
    "This library allows Python to connect to MySQL databases and run SQL queries directly from the code.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **Pandas** (`pandas`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. In this notebook, we use Pandas to handle the data returned from the MySQL query and display it in a clean format.\n",

    "- **Installation**: `pip install pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **dotenv** (`python-dotenv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dotenv` library loads environment variables from a `.env` file. This is essential for storing **sensitive information** such as database credentials securely and prevents them from being hardcoded in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Installation**: `pip install python-dotenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **IPython.display** (`IPython`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This module provides the `display()` function that is used to render Pandas DataFrames nicely in Jupyter notebooks, making them more readable.\n",

       "5  Featuring a carefully chosen, solid Canadian cedar top and laminated bubinga back and sides, the Caballero 11 classical guitar is a beauty to behold and play. The headstock and fretboard are of Indian rosewood. Nickel-plated tuners and Silver-plated frets are installed to last a lifetime. The body binding and wood rosette are exquisite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rodriguez Guitar is hand crafted and glued to create precise balances. From the invisible careful sanding, even inside the body, that ensures the finished instrument's purity of tone, to the beautifully unique rosette inlays around the soundhole and on the back of the neck, each guitar is a credit to its luthier and worthy of being handed down from one generation to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tone, resonance and beauty of fine guitars are all dependent upon the wood from which they are made. The wood used in the construction of Rodriguez guitars is carefully chosen and aged to guarantee the highest quality. No wood is purchased before the tree has been cut down, and at least 2 years must elapse before the tree is turned into lumber. The wood has to be well cut from the log. The grain must be close and absolutely vertical. The shop is totally free from humidity.   \n",

      "5  Featuring a carefully chosen, solid Canadian cedar top and laminated bubinga back and sides, the Caballero 11 classical guitar is a beauty to behold and play. The headstock and fretboard are of Indian rosewood. Nickel-plated tuners and Silver-plated frets are installed to last a lifetime. The body binding and wood rosette are exquisite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rodriguez Guitar is hand crafted and glued to create precise balances. From the invisible careful sanding, even inside the body, that ensures the finished instrument's purity of tone, to the beautifully unique rosette inlays around the soundhole and on the back of the neck, each guitar is a credit to its luthier and worthy of being handed down from one generation to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tone, resonance and beauty of fine guitars are all dependent upon the wood from which they are made. The wood used in the construction of Rodriguez guitars is carefully chosen and aged to guarantee the highest quality. No wood is purchased before the tree has been cut down, and at least 2 years must elapse before the tree is turned into lumber. The wood has to be well cut from the log. The grain must be close and absolutely vertical. The shop is totally free from humidity.   \n",

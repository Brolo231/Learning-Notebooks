    "# Introduction to DDL (Data definition Language) with MySQL \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Definition Language (DDL) statements define and manage database structures like tables, indexes, and schemas. Key commands include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```CREATE```: To create new objects (e.g., tables, databases).\n",
    "- ```ALTER```: To modify existing objects (e.g., add/remove columns, change data types).\n",
    "- ```DROP```: To delete objects (e.g., tables).\n",
    "- ```RENAME```: To rename objects.\n",
    "- ```TRUNCATE```: To remove all data from a table while keeping the structure (technically DML but often grouped with DDL for table management).\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDL operations are auto-committed in MySQL (no rollback unless in a transaction with InnoDB). They can lock tables, impacting performance in production.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database:** Top-level container; holds tables etc. \\\n",
    "**Schema:** Synonym for database in MySQL \\\n",
    "**SQL Standard:** Schema is usually inside a database; MySQL merges the two concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create a sample database if not exists\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS learning_db;\n",
    "USE learning_db;\n",

    "# Data Types in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding data types is crucial before creating tables, as they define how data is stored, validated, and queried. MySQL supports numeric, string, date/time, spatial, and JSON types. Choose types based on data range, storage efficiency, and query needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Data Types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numeric Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```TINYINT:``` 1 byte, -128 to 127 (or 0-255 unsigned).\n",
    "```SMALLINT:``` 2 bytes, -32,768 to 32,767.\\\n",
    "```INT or INTEGER:``` 4 bytes, -2^31 to 2^31-1 (most common for IDs).\\\n",
    "```BIGINT:``` 8 bytes, for large numbers.\\\n",
    "```FLOAT/DOUBLE:``` For floating-point numbers (approximate; use DECIMAL for precision).\\\n",
    "```DECIMAL(M,D):``` Exact decimal, e.g., DECIMAL(10,2) for currency (up to 10 digits, 2 after decimal).\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### String Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```CHAR(M):``` Fixed-length, up to 255 chars (padded with spaces). \\\n",
    "```VARCHAR(M):``` Variable-length, up to 65,535 chars (efficient for varying lengths). \\\n",
    "```TEXT:``` For long text, up to 65,535 chars (use for >255 chars).\\\n",
    "```MEDIUMTEXT/LONGTEXT:``` For even longer text (up to 16MB/4GB).\\\n",
    "```ENUM('value1', 'value2'):``` Restricts to predefined values.\\\n",
    "```SET('value1', 'value2'):``` Allows multiple predefined values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Date and Time Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```DATE:``` YYYY-MM-DD.\\\n",
    "```TIME:``` HH:MM:SS.\\\n",
    "```DATETIME:``` YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (stores both).\\\n",
    "```TIMESTAMP:``` Similar to DATETIME but auto-updates on insert/update (UTC-based).\\\n",
    "```YEAR:``` 4-digit year.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```BOOLEAN or TINYINT(1):``` 0/1 for true/false.\\\n",
    "```BLOB/MEDIUMBLOB/LONGBLOB:``` For binary data (e.g., images).\\\n",
    "```JSON:``` For structured JSON data (MySQL 5.7+).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the smallest type that fits your data to save storage (e.g., TINYINT for status flags).\n",
    "- Avoid FLOAT for money; use DECIMAL.\n",
    "- For strings, prefer VARCHAR over CHAR unless fixed length is needed.\n",
    "- Add UNSIGNED for non-negative numbers to double range (e.g., INT UNSIGNED).\n",
    "- Use DEFAULT values and NOT NULL to enforce data integrity.\n",
    "- Consider character sets (e.g., UTF8MB4 for emojis/multilingual support).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Data types can be changed later with ALTER TABLE, but it may cause data loss or require table rebuilds (especially in large tables)\n",

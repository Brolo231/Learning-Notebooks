    "# What is Data Analytics? \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analytics is the practice of examining raw data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that support decision-making. It can involve simple descriptive analysis (summarizing what happened), diagnostic analysis (understanding why it happened), predictive analysis (forecasting what will happen), and prescriptive analysis (recommending actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "While advanced analytics often requires data scientists, modern platforms provide tools such as natural language queries and automated insights that empower business users as well. Data analytics is closely related to business intelligence (BI), which focuses on reporting and visualization, but analytics goes further by applying statistical, computational, and sometimes machine learning techniques to generate forward-looking insight\n",

    "\n",
    "These three terms are often used together, but they are not the same thing. Here‚Äôs how they connect:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Big Data\n",
    "Big data refers to the massive amounts of information being created every second‚Äîfrom databases, IoT devices, social media, emails, and more. The role of big data is to provide the raw material. You can think of it as the fuel that powers analytics. The more data available, the richer the insights you can gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Data Analytics\n",
    "Data analytics is the process of examining data to find patterns, trends, and insights that help businesses make better decisions. It turns big data into something useful‚Äîlike an engine that runs on the fuel of big data. Analytics can be descriptive (what happened), diagnostic (why it happened), predictive (what might happen), or prescriptive (what to do next).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Data Science\n",
    "Data science is the broader field that studies how to work with data to generate meaning. Data scientists often design the models, algorithms, and advanced techniques that make analytics more powerful. You can think of the data scientist as the mechanic or engineer who builds and tunes the analytics engine.\n",

    "## The Four Main Types of Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Descriptive Analytics ‚Äì What happened?\n",
    "- Focuses on summarizing past data: ‚Äúhow many, when, where, and what.‚Äù\n",
    "- Examples: sales reports, website traffic dashboards, monthly marketing performance. \\\n",
    "Two kinds:\n",
    "    - Canned reports ‚Üí pre-designed, regularly generated (e.g., monthly ad performance).\n",
    "\t- Ad hoc reports ‚Üí custom reports created on the fly for a specific question (e.g., which city engages most with your social media page).\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Think of descriptive analytics as your rearview mirror‚Äîit shows where you‚Äôve been.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚∏ª\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Diagnostic Analytics ‚Äì Why did it happen?\n",
    "- Digs deeper into past data to find causes and correlations.\n",
    "- Tools include drill downs, queries, alerts, and data mining. \\\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "    - A drop in sales ‚Üí drill down reveals a sales rep was on vacation.\n",
    "\t- Low staff hours ‚Üí an alert warns this could reduce closed deals.\n",
    "\t- Also helps ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù new insights, like identifying the most qualified job candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Diagnostic analytics is like a detective, finding the reasons behind events.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚∏ª\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Predictive Analytics ‚Äì What might happen?\n",
    "- Uses statistical models and machine learning to forecast future outcomes.\n",
    "- Helps find trends, correlations, and causation.\n",
    "- Example: Predicting how a Facebook T-shirt ad campaign will perform based on audience age, income, or location.\n",
    "- Can estimate potential revenue across different target groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Predictive analytics is your crystal ball, giving a glimpse into possible futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚∏ª\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Prescriptive Analytics ‚Äì What should we do?\n",
    "- The most advanced type‚Äîgoes beyond prediction to recommend actions.\n",
    "- Uses AI, big data, and optimization techniques to suggest the best approach. \\\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "    - Testing different slogans or ad designs to see which performs best.\n",
    "    - Recommending the shirt color most likely to appeal to older customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Prescriptive analytics is like a coach, telling you the best move to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><hr style=\"width: 60%; margin: auto;\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ Descriptive ‚Üí what happened (reporting).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ Diagnostic ‚Üí why it happened (causes).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ Predictive ‚Üí what might happen (forecasting).\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ Prescriptive ‚Üí what to do about it (recommendations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these four levels of analytics move from looking back ‚Üí understanding ‚Üí looking forward ‚Üí taking action."

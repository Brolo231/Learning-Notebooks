    "# An introduction to Statistics as a skillset for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistics is one of the many pillars of data science that enables us to transform raw data into actionable insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics' use case in Data Science: \n",
    "- **Data Understanding**: Statistics helps you summarize and describe the main features of a dataset (e.g., average, variability).\n",
    "- **Uncertainty Handling**: Real-world data is messy and incomplete. Statistics helps quantify uncertainty and make informed decisions despite it.\n",
    "- **Pattern Detection**: You can identify trends, correlations, and anomalies that might not be obvious just by looking at raw data.\n",
    "- **Modeling and Prediction**: Statistical methods are the foundation of machine learning models (especially supervised learning).\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Testing**: You can test assumptions or claims about data, which is essential for experiments (A/B testing, clinical trials, etc.)."

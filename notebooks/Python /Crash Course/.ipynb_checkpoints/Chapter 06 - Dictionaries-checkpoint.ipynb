    "A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A key’s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following dictionary example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(alien_0['color'])\n",
    ">>> print(alien_0['points'])\n",
    "\n",
    "green\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing values in a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the value associated with a key, give the name of the dictionary and then place the key inside a set of square brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}\n",
    ">>> print(alien_0['color'])\n",
    "\n",
    "green\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding new key-value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary at any time. To add a new key-value pair, you would give the name of the dictionary followed by the new key in square brackets, along with the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    ">>> print(alien_0)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> alien_0['x_position'] = 0\n",
    ">>> alien_0['y_position'] = 25\n",
    ">>> print(alien_0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    "{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries retain the order in which they were defined. When you print a dictionary or loop through its elements, you will see the elements in the same order they were added to the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing key-value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "When you no longer need a piece of information that’s stored in a dictionary, you can use the del statement to completely remove a key-value pair. All del needs is the name of the dictionary and the key that you want to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    ">>> print(alien_0)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> del alien_0['points']\n",
    ">>> print(alien_0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    "{'color': 'green'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the deleted key-value pair is removed permanently\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing elements using the get() method\n",
    "\n",
    "The get() method requires a key as a first argument. As a second optional argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn’t exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'No point value assigned.')\n",
    ">>> print(point_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "No point value assigned.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s a chance the key you’re asking for might not exist, consider using the get() method instead of the square bracket notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you leave out the second argument in the call to get() and the key doesn’t exist, Python will return the value None, which means “no value exists.”\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looping through all Key-Value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a for loop together with the .tems() method to iterate over all the keys and values from a dictionary \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> user_0 = {\n",
    "        'username': 'efermi',\n",
    "        'first': 'enrico',\n",
    "        'last': 'fermi',\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> for key, value in user_0.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"\\nKey: {key}\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Value: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Key: username\n",
    "Value: efermi\n",
    "\n",
    "Key: first\n",
    "Value: enrico\n",
    "\n",
    "Key: last\n",
    "Value: fermi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping through all the keys in a dictionary \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then loop through just the keys from a dictionary by replacing the .tems() method with the .keys() method instead \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> favorite_languages = {\n",
    "        'jen': 'python',\n",
    "        'sarah': 'c',\n",
    "        'edward': 'rust',\n",
    "        'phil': 'python',\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> for name in favorite_languages.keys():\n",
    "        print(name.title())\n",
    "\n",
    "Jen\n",
    "Sarah\n",
    "Edward\n",
    "Phil\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Looping through keys is the default behaviour when looping through a dictionary so ```for name in favourite_languages``` would be the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the keys() method to find out if a particular person was polled based on the example above\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> if 'erin' not in favorite_languages.keys():\n",
    "        print(\"Erin, please take our poll!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Erin, please take our poll!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping through All values in a Dictionary \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how we used .keys() to retrieve only the keys from a dictionary, we can use the same concept but for retrieving only values by using the .value() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> for language in favorite_languages.values():\n",
    "        print(language.title())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$new_page$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## sets \n",
    "\n",
    "Sets look like dictionaries because they are also enclosed in curly braces {}. However, unlike dictionaries and lists, sets do not retain the original order in which values were added to the set. Additionally, sets do not allow duplicate values \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_set = {'python', 'java', 'c#'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets support:\n",
    "- add()\n",
    "- remove()\n",
    "- discard()\n",
    "- clear()\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets only allow immutable types to be stored: \n",
    "- int\n",
    "- float\n",
    "- str\n",
    "- tuple\n",
    "- frozenset"

This is true of most programming languages, and the reason has to do with how the list operations are implemented at a lower level.\n\n### \u20121\ufe0f\u20e3 Negative index values \n\n- Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. If you ask for the item at index ```-1```, Python always returns the last item in the list:\n\n-This convention extends to other negative index values as well. The index -2 returns the second item from the end of the list, the index -3 returns the third item from the end, and so forth.\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Modifying Elements in a List \n\n- To change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have.\n\n### Appending elements to a list \n\n- When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end of the list.\n\n```\n>>> x = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> x.append('d')\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n```\n\n### Inserting elements into a list\n\n- You can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() method. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the value of the new item:\n\n\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n>>> motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati)\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n```\n\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Removing elements from a list \n\n- If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can use the del statement:\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n>>> del motorcycles[0]\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n['yamaha', 'suzuki']\n```\n\n### removing an item using the pop() method\n\n- The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it unlike the del statement\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n>>> popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n>>> print(popped_motorcycle)\n```\n\n### Removing an item by value\n\n- Sometimes you won\u2019t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method.\n\n```\n>>> motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n>>> motorcycles.remove('ducati')\n>>> print(motorcycles)\n\n['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']\n```\n\n### Note: \n\nThe ```remove()``` method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there\u2019s a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you\u2019ll need to use a loop to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Organizing a list\n\nSometimes we want to present information in a particular order. Python provides a number of different ways to organize lists. \n\n### Sorting a list permanently with the sort() method\n\nWe can use sort() to sort items alphabetically or reverse-alphabetical order. \n\n```\n>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n>>> cars.sort()\n>>> print(cars)\n\n['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']\n```\n\nWe can also pass the argument ```reverse=True``` to display the sorted list in reverse-alphabetical order.\n\n```\n>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n>>> cars.sort(reverse=True)\n>>> print(cars)\n\n['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi']\n```\n\n### Sorting a list temporarily using the sorted() function \n\nInstead of using sort() which alters the original object, we can use sorted() which does not alter the original list. \n\n### Printing a list in Reverse Order\n\nTo reverse the original order of a list, you can use the reverse() method. This permanently changes the order of the list \n\n```\n>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']\n>>> cars.reverse()\n>>> print(cars)\n\n['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']\n```\n\n**Notice** that reverse() doesn\u2019t sort backward alphabetically; it simply reverses the order of the list:\n\n### Finding the length of a list \n\nYou can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function."

    "content": "# Dictionaries\n\n<hr>\n\n## Table of Contents \n\n- Pg 2: Dictionaries\n- Pg 3: Accessing values in a Dictionary\n- Pg 4: Adding new key-value pairs\n- Pg 5: Removing key-value pairs\n- Pg 6: Accessing values with get()\n- Pg 7: Looping through all key-value pairs\n- Pg 8: Sets\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Dictioanries\n\nA dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A key\u2019s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.\n\nIn Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces\n\nConsider the following dictionary example: \n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n\n>>> print(alien_0['color'])\n>>> print(alien_0['points'])\n\ngreen\n5\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Accessing values in a Dictionary\n\nTo get the value associated with a key, give the name of the dictionary and then place the key inside a set of square brackets\n\nFor example: \n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}\n>>> print(alien_0['color'])\n\ngreen\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Adding new key-value pairs\n\nDictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary at any time. To add a new key-value pair, you would give the name of the dictionary followed by the new key in square brackets, along with the new value.\n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n>>> alien_0['x_position'] = 0\n>>> alien_0['y_position'] = 25\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25}\n```\n\nDictionaries retain the order in which they were defined. When you print a dictionary or loop through its elements, you will see the elements in the same order they were added to the dictionary.\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Removing key-value pairs\n\nWhen you no longer need a piece of information that\u2019s stored in a dictionary, you can use the del statement to completely remove a key-value pair. All del needs is the name of the dictionary and the key that you want to remove.\n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n>>> del alien_0['points']\n>>> print(alien_0)\n\n\n{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n{'color': 'green'}\n```\n\nNote that the deleted key-value pair is removed permanently\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Accessing elements using the get() method\n\nThe get() method requires a key as a first argument. As a second optional argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn\u2019t exist:\n\n```\n>>> alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}\n\n>>> point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'No point value assigned.')\n>>> print(point_value)\n\nNo point value assigned.\n```\n\nIf there\u2019s a chance the key you\u2019re asking for might not exist, consider using the get() method instead of the square bracket notation.\n\n**Note:** If you leave out the second argument in the call to get() and the key doesn\u2019t exist, Python will return the value None, which means \u201cno value exists.\u201d\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Looping through all Key-Value pairs\n\nWe can use a for loop together with the .tems() method to iterate over all the keys and values from a dictionary \n\n```\n>>> user_0 = {\n        'username': 'efermi',\n        'first': 'enrico',\n        'last': 'fermi',\n        }\n\n>>> for key, value in user_0.items():\n        print(f\"\\nKey: {key}\")\n        print(f\"Value: {value}\")\n\nKey: username\nValue: efermi\n\nKey: first\nValue: enrico\n\nKey: last\nValue: fermi\n```\n\n### Looping through all the keys in a dictionary \n\nWe can then loop through just the keys from a dictionary by replacing the .tems() method with the .keys() method instead \n\n```\n>>> favorite_languages = {\n        'jen': 'python',\n        'sarah': 'c',\n        'edward': 'rust',\n        'phil': 'python',\n        }\n\n>>> for name in favorite_languages.keys():\n        print(name.title())\n\nJen\nSarah\nEdward\nPhil\n```\n\n**Note:** Looping through keys is the default behaviour when looping through a dictionary so ```for name in favourite_languages``` would be the same. \n\nWe can also use the keys() method to find out if a particular person was polled based on the example above\n\n```\n>>> if 'erin' not in favorite_languages.keys():\n        print(\"Erin, please take our poll!\")\n\nErin, please take our poll!\n```\n\n### Looping through All values in a Dictionary \n\nJust like how we used .keys() to retrieve only the keys from a dictionary, we can use the same concept but for retrieving only values by using the .value() method. \n\n```\n>>> for language in favorite_languages.values():\n        print(language.title())\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## sets \n\nSets look like dictionaries because they are also enclosed in curly braces {}. However, unlike dictionaries and lists, sets do not retain the original order in which values were added to the set. Additionally, sets do not allow duplicate values \n\n```\nmy_set = {'python', 'java', 'c#'}\n```\n\nSets support:\n- add()\n- remove()\n- discard()\n- clear()\n\nSets only allow immutable types to be stored: \n- int\n- float\n- str\n- tuple\n- frozenset"

    "content": "# User Input and While Loops\n\n<hr>\n\n## Table of Contents \n\n- Pg 2: input()\n- Pg 3: Using int() to accept numerical input\n- Pg 4: The Modulo Operator %\n- Pg 5: while loops\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## How the input() function works\n\nThe input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text. Once Python receives the user\u2019s input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with.\n\n```\n>>> message = input(\"Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: \")\n>>> print(message)\n\n\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: Hello everyone!\nHello everyone!\n```\n\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll want to write a prompt that\u2019s longer than one line. We can acheive this through the use of the += operator:\n\n```\n>>> prompt = \"If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\"\n>>> prompt += \"\\nWhat is your first name? \"\n\n>>> name = input(prompt)\n>>> print(f\"\\nHello, {name}!\")\n\nIf you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.\nWhat is your first name? Eric\n\nHello, Eric!\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Using int() to accept numerical input \n\nSometimes we will want user input in a numerical format, for example, age. By default input() stores user input as a string, therefore, we can use int() to convert user input to type int\n\n```\n>>> age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n\nHow old are you? 21\n\n>>> age\n\n21\n\n>>> age > 18\n\nTrue\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## The modulo operator \n\nA useful tool for working with numerical information is the modulo operator (%), which divides one number by another number and returns the remainder:\n\n```\n>>> 4 % 3\n1\n>>> 5 % 3\n2\n>>> 6 % 3\n0\n>>> 7 % 3\n1\n```\n\nWe can use this logic to determine if a number is even or if it is odd. When ```if number % 2 is equal to 0``` then 'number' is even \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Introducing while loops\n\nThe while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition is true.\n\n```\n>>> num = 1\n>>> while num <= 5:\n        print(num)\n        num += 1\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\n### Letting the user choose when to quit the while loop \n\n```\n>>> message = \"\"\n>>> while message != 'quit':\n        message = input(\"type 'quit' to quit: \")\n        print(f\"You typed: {message}\")\n\ntype 'quit' to quit: quit\nYou typed: quit\n```\n\n### Using break to Exit a loop\n\n```\nnum = 5\n>>> while True:\n        print(num)\n        num += 1\n        if num >= 10:\n            break\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n```\n\n### Using continue in a Loop\n\nRather than breaking out of a loop entirely without executing the rest of its code, you can use the continue statement to return to the beginning of the loop, based on the result of a conditional test. For example, consider a loop that counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range:\n\n```\ncurrent_number = 0\n>>> while current_number < 10:\n        current_number += 1\n        if current_number % 2 == 0:\n           continue\n\n        print(current_number)\n\n\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n```\n\nIf a while loop continues forever press CTRL-C to stop the program from running\n\n### Removing all instances of specific values from a List \n\nSay you have a list of pets with the value 'cat' repeated several times. To remove all instances of that value, you can run a while loop until 'cat' is no longer in the list, as shown here:\n\n```\n>>> pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']\n>>> print(pets)\n\n>>> while 'cat' in pets:\n>>>     pets.remove('cat')\n\n>>> print(pets)\n```"

Instead of a rewriting code over and over, we can *call* a function, this makes python run the code inside the function. \n\n```\ndef greet_user():\n    \"\"\" Display a simple greeting \"\"\"\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n\ngreet_user()\n```\n\n- 'def' is used to define a function in python \n- The line under the function name is a comment called the *doc-string* this describes what the function does\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Passing information to a function \n\n```\ndef greet_user(username):\n    \"\"\" Display a personal greeting \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {username.title}!\")\n\ngreet_user(\"john\")\n\nHello, John!\n```\n\n### Arguments and Parameters \n\n- In the previous block of code we defined a function that accepted a variable 'username'. This is called a parameter\n\n- When we pass the value for this paramter in the calling of the function it is called an argument. In the example above 'john' is the argument and username is the parameter\n\n$$new_page$$ \n\n## Positional arguments \n\nWhen you call a function, Python must match each argument in the function call with a parameter in the function definition. The simplest way to do this is based on the order of the arguments provided. Values matched up this way are called *positional arguments*.\n\n```\ndef pets(breed, name):\n    \"\"\" Displays information about pets \"\"\"\n    print(f\"My {breed}'s name is {name.title()}.\")\n\npets(\"rottweiler\", \"bruce\")\npets(\"golden retriever\", \"max\")\n```\n\nA function may be called multiple times as shown above \n\n### keyword arguments\n\nA keyword argument is a name-value pair that you pass to a function. You directly associate the name and the value within the argument, so when you pass the argument to the function, there\u2019s no confusion (you won\u2019t end up with a harry named Hamster). Keyword arguments free you from having to worry about correctly ordering your arguments in the function call, and they clarify the role of each value in the function call.\n\n```\ndef pets(breed, name):\n    \"\"\" Displays information about pets \"\"\"\n    print(f\"My {breed}'s name is {name.title()}.\")\n\npets(name=\"bruce\", breed=\"rottweiler\")\n```\n\n**Notice:** we are able to place our keyword arguments in any order because we are defining which parameter the argument is passed to.\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Default values \n\nWhen writing a function, you can define a default value for each parameter. If an argument for a parameter is provided in the function call, Python uses the argument value. If not, it uses the parameter\u2019s default value.\n\n```\n>>> def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):\n        \"\"\"Display information about a pet.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"\\nI have a {animal_type}.\")\n        print(f\"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\n\n>>> describe_pet(pet_name='willie')\n\nI have a dog.\nMy dog's name is Willie.\n```\n\n**Note:** the above is using positional arguments functionality, if animal_type='dog' was first and the user passed only \"willie\" there would be a SyntaxError\n\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Return Values \n\nA function doesn\u2019t always have to display its output directly. Instead, it can process some data and then return a value or set of values. The return statement takes a value from inside a function and sends it back to the line that called the function.\n\n```\n>>> def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):\n        \"\"\"Return a full name, neatly formatted.\"\"\"\n         full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\n         return full_name.title()\n\n>>> musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix')\n>>> print(musician)\n\nJimi Hendrix\n```\n\n$$new_page$$ \n\n## *args\n\n```*args``` are used to collect extra positional arguments into a tuple\n\n```\n>>> def add_numbers(*args):\n        print(args)\n\n>>> add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n(1, 2, 3, 4)\n```\n\n**Note:** Name args is a convention, not required\n\n$$new_page$$ \n\n## **kwargs\n\nkwargs are variable keyword arguments.

When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have \n\nWithout classes:\n- no objects\n- no encapsulation\n- no inheritence\n- no polymoprhism\n\nAlthough we have not learnt the above yet, these form the 4 pillars of OOP \n\n### What is an object? \n\nAn object is a real instance that is created from a class \n\n### Creating a simple class\n\n```\nclass Dog:\n\n    # doc-string describing what the class does \n    \"\"\"A simple attempt to model a dog.\"\"\" \n\n     def __init__(self, name, age):\n        \"\"\"Initialize name and age attributes.\"\"\"\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n     def sit(self):\n        \"\"\"Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"{self.name} is now sitting.\")\n\n     def roll_over(self):\n        \"\"\"Simulate rolling over in response to a command.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"{self.name} rolled over!\")\n```\n\nBy convention, capitalized names refer to classes in python \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n### The __init__() method \n\nA function that is part of a class is called a method. The ```__init__()``` method is a special method that python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the Dog class. \n\nTo understand the ```self``` paarmeter we can compre the difference between a class and a function. A function is also an object in python, however it is usually stateless by default which means when you reuse a function it has no memory of previous calls to it. However when we create an instance of a class the changes we make to that instance persist in memory and previous changes are remembered. Now ```self``` does the follwoing:  \n\n- self = \u201cthis specific object\u201d\n- It allows methods to access and modify that object\u2019s own data\n\nThe following example showcases this distinction between using self and not using self\n\n```\nclass Example:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.persistent = 0      # stored in the object (uses self)\n        temporary = 0           # local variable (NO self) \u2014 useless here\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.persistent += 1    # modifies object state\n        temporary = 0           # local variable created fresh each call\n        temporary += 1\n\n        print(\"self.persistent =\", self.persistent)\n        print(\"temporary =\", temporary)\n```\n\nNow if we ran the following :\n\n```\ne = Example()\n\ne.increment()\ne.increment()\ne.increment()\n```\n\nWe would get this out put: \n\n```\nself.persistent = 1\ntemporary = 1\n\nself.persistent = 2\ntemporary = 1\n\nself.persistent = 3\ntemporary = 1\n```\n\nAny variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and we\u2019ll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class.\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Attributes\n\nThere are two types of attributes:\n- Instance attributes\n    - These belong to each object separately  \n- Class attributes\n    - These belong to the class itself, and are shared by all instances.\n\n\n```\nclass User:\n    total_users = 0   # class attribute\n\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        User.total_users += 1\n        self.name = name   # instance attribute\n```\n\n### Default attribute values \n\nWe can use default attribute values similarily to how we used default paramter values in functions \n\n```\nclass User:\n    def __init__(self, username, active = True, role = 'user'):\n        self.username = username\n        self.active = active\n        self.role = role\n\nu1 = User(\"john\")\nu2 = User(\"alice\", role=\"admin\")\n\nprint(u2.role)\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Inheritance \n\nInheritance allows you to define new classes based on other versions of classes previously written. \n\nWhen one class inherits from another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class.\n\nThe original class is called the parent class (superclass), and the new class is the child class (subclass). The child class can inherit any or all of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it\u2019s also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.\n\nThe following is a simple example of a class inheriting the methods and attributes from another class \n\n```\nclass Car:\n    \"\"\"A simple attempt to represent a car.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n        \"\"\"Initialize attributes to describe a car.\"\"\"\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.odometer_reading = 0\n\n    def get_descriptive_name(self):\n        \"\"\"Return a neatly formatted descriptive name.\"\"\"\n        long_name = f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\"\n        return long_name.title()\n\n    def read_odometer(self):\n        \"\"\"Print a statement showing the car's mileage.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.\")\n\n    def update_odometer(self, mileage):\n        \"\"\"Set the odometer reading to the given value.\"\"\"\n        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:\n            self.odometer_reading = mileage\n        else:\n            print(\"You can't roll back an odometer!\")\n\n    def increment_odometer(self, miles):\n        \"\"\"Add the given amount to the odometer reading.\"\"\"\n        self.odometer_reading += miles\n\nclass ElectricCar(Car):\n    \"\"\"Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n        \"\"\"Initialize attributes of the parent class.\"\"\"\n        super().__init__(make, model, year)\n\n\n\u277a my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)\nprint(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())\n```\n\n**Note:** ```The super()``` function is a specialized function that allows you to call a method from the parent class. \n\nTo inherit the properties from another class we simply input the parent class's name in the parentheses of the new child class we are creating \n\n**Note:** When you inherit from another class, that child class automatically has access to all the parent class's methods and attributes \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Overriding methods from the parent class \n\nYou can override any method from the parent class that doesn\u2019t fit what you\u2019re trying to model with the child class. To do this, you define a method in the child class with the same name as the method you want to override in the parent class. Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method you define in the child class.\n\n```\nclass ElectricCar(Car):\n    --snip--\n\n    def fill_gas_tank(self):\n        \"\"\"Electric cars don't have gas tanks.\"\"\"\n        print(\"This car doesn't have a gas tank!\")\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Composition \n\nComposition is when:\n- One class owns another class as part of itself\n- The relationship is: \u201chas a\u201d, not \u201cis a\u201d\n\n```\nclass Car:\n     --snip--\n\nclass Battery:\n     \"\"\"A simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car.\"\"\"\n\n     def __init__(self, battery_size=40):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the battery's attributes.\"\"\"\n        self.battery_size = battery_size\n\n     def describe_battery(self):\n        \"\"\"Print a statement describing the battery size.\"\"\"\n        print(f\"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.\")\n\n\nclass ElectricCar(Car):\n    \"\"\"Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize attributes of the parent class.\n        Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__(make, model, year)\n        self.battery = Battery()\n\nmy_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)\nprint(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())\nmy_leaf.battery.describe_battery()\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Importing classes \n\nPython allows you to store classes in modules and then import the classes you need into your main program \n\nIt is good practice to write a doc-string for each module you create \n\nTo import a class from a module we can call the python file name and then import the class using the Class Name\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nfrom car import Car\n```\n\n### Importing an Entire Module\n\nWe can also import an entire module and then access the classes you need using dot notation. \n\n```\nimport car\n```\n\n### Using aliases \n\nWhen importing from a module we can use an alias to shorten the keyword we need to enter in order to call the class \n\n```\nfrom electric_car import ElectricCar as EC\n```\n\n## Terminology \n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|--------|\n| Class | A blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects |\n| Object | A real instance created from a class |\n| Method | A function that belongs to a class |\n| Attribute | A variable that belongs to an object or a class |\n| Instance attribute | An attribute that belongs to a specific object (each object has its own copy) |\n| Class attribute | An attribute shared by all instances of a class |\n| Constructor | The `__init__()` method that initializes a new object |\n| self | Refers to the current object; used to access its attributes and methods |\n| Inheritance | \u201cis a\u201d relationship (e.g., Dog is an Animal) |\n| Parent / Base class | The class being inherited from |\n| Child / Subclass | The class that inherits from another class |\n| super() | Calls a method from the parent class, usually the constructor |\n| Overriding | Replacing a parent class method with a new version in the child class |\n| Composition | \u201chas a\u201d relationship (e.g., Car has an Engine) |\n| Component class | A class that is contained inside another class (used in composition) |\n| Encapsulation | Keeping data and behavior together and controlling access to them |\n| Polymorphism | Different objects responding differently to the same method name |\n| Module | A Python file that contains classes or functions |\n| Import | Bringing a class or module into another file so it can be used |\n| Alias | A short alternative name given during import (e.g., `as EC`) |"

Looping is important because it automates repetitive tasks\n\n```\n>>> cars = [\"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\"]\n\n>>> for car in cars:\n>>>     print(car)\n\nAudi\nBMW\nFord\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Making numerical lists\n\n### range()\n\nLists are ideal for storing sets of numbers, and Python provides a variety of tools to help you work efficiently with lists of numbers.\n\nPython\u2019s ```range()``` function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers. For example, you can use the range() function to print a series of numbers like this:\n\n```\n>>> for value in range(1, 5):\n>>>    print(value)\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n```\n\n### using range() to make a list of Numbers\n\n```\n>>> numbers = list(range(1,6))\n>>> print(numbers)\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nWe can also pass a thrid argument to ```range()``` which will tell python to use that value as a step in generating the numbers \n\nFor Example, the following creates a list of even numbers: \n\n```\n>>> even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))\n>>> print(even_numbers)\n\n[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n\n## Simple statistics with a List of Numbers \n\nA few Python functions are helpful when working with lists of numbers. For example, you can easily find the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of numbers:\n\n```\n>>> digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]\n>>> min(digits)\n0\n>>> max(digits)\n9\n>>> sum(digits)\n45\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n\n## List comprehensions\n\nA list comprehension combines the for loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically appends each new element.\n\nThe following list comprehension generateas a list contasining square numbers 1-10\n\n```\n>>> squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]\n>>> print(squares)\n\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```\n\nTo use this syntax, begin with a descriptive name for the list, such as squares. Next, open a set of square brackets and define the expression for the values you want to store in the new list. In this example the expression is value**2, which raises the value to the second power. Then, write a for loop to generate the numbers you want to feed into the expression, and close the square brackets. The for loop in this example is for value in range(1, 11), which feeds the values 1 through 10 into the expression value**2. Note that no colon is used at the end of the for statement.\n\nWe can also add condtionals to list comprehensions in the following way: \n\n```\n[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n```\n\nPython allows inline conditional expressions (also called a ternary expression):\n\n```\nvalue_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Working with part of a list \n\nA slice, in python, refers to working with a specific group of items from a list. \n\n### Slicing a List \n\nTo slice a list we need to specify two indexes. The first is where the slice starts (this value is included in the slice), the second index is where we want the slice to end (excluding this value in the slice) \n\n```\n>>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n>>> print(players[0:3])\n\n['charles', 'martina', 'michael']\n```\n\n**Note:** If you omit the first index, python starts the slice at the beginning of the list, the same principle applies with a slice unitl the end of the list \n\nRecall that a negative index returns an element a certain distance from the end of a list; therefore, you can output any slice from the end of a list.\n\n```\n>>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n>>> print(players[-3:])\n\n['michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n```\n\n### Looping through a slice \n\n```\n>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, ,5 ,6]\n\n>>> for number in numbers[-3:]:\n>>>     print(number)\n\n4\n5\n6\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Copying a List\n\nTo copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]). This tells Python to make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, producing a copy of the entire list.\n\n```\n>>> favourite_foods = ['apple', 'grape', 'watermelon']\n>>> fruits = favourite_foods[:]\n\n>>> print(fruits)\n\n['apple', 'grape', 'watermelon']\n```\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Tuples\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll want to create a list of items that cannot change. Tuples allow you to do just that. Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable list is called a tuple.\n\nA tuple looks just like a list, except you use parentheses instead of square brackets. Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by using each item\u2019s index, just as you would for a list.\n\nFor example, if we have a rectangle that should always be a certain size, we can ensure that its size doesn\u2019t change by putting the dimensions into a tuple:\n\n```\n>>> dimensions = (200, 50)\n>>> print(dimensions[0])\n>>> print(dimensions[1])\n\n200\n50\n```\n\n\nNow if we try to change one of the items from a tuple: \n\n```\n>>> dimensions = (200, 50)\n>>> dimensions[0] = 250\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"dimensions.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    dimensions[0] = 250\nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n```\n\n**Note:** Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with one element, you need to include a trailing comma:\n\n```my_t = (3,)```"

They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.  \\\nFor instance, you can call a variable: \\\n\u2705 ```message_1``` \\\nbut not \\\n\u274c ```1_message.```\n\n<br>\n\n\u2705 variable references -> object (value) \\\n\u274c variables do not store values \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Data Types \nBecause most programs define and gather some sort of data and then do something useful with it, it helps to classify different types of data. \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Strings\nA string is a series of characters. Anything placed within single or double quotes in python is a string. \n\n<br>\n\n### Useful String Methods:\n\n- title()\n- upper()\n- lower()\n\nWhen storing data it is useful to store it using lower(), as user data is not trustworthy when it comes to capitalization\n\n<br>\n\n### Python f-strings\n    \nf-strings (f stands for format) allow variables to be passed within strings with which python replaces the variable with the object / value associated with that variable. \n\n<br>\n\n### Adding whitespae to strings with Tabs and Newlines\n\nTo add a tab to text we can use the following character combination: `\\t`\n\nTo add a newline we can use the following character combination: `\\n`\n\n<br>\n\n### Stripping whitespace in python\n\nWe can either strip whitespace to the left of a string. the right, or all the whitespace. \n\n- lstrip()\n- rstrip()\n- strip()\n\nNote that the above string methods do not alter the variables object in place. To alter the variables object we need to asign the variable to the updated value. \n\nFor e.g. \\\n`x = x.strip()`\n\n### Removing Prefixes and suffixes\n\nWe can use the following methods: `removeprefix(prefix_to_remove_from_string)` \\\n`removesuffix(...)`\n\nRemember, just like how strip() does not alter the object associated with the variable that we apply these methods to, the same principle applies with removeprefix(). \n\n$$new_page$$\n\n## Numbers\n\n### Integers \nYou can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.\n\n```\n>>> 2 + 3\n5\n>>> 3 - 2\n1\n>>> 2 * 3\n6\n>>> 3 / 2\n1.5\n```\n\nPython uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents:\n\n```\n>>> 3 ** 2\n9\n>>> 3 ** 3\n27\n>>> 10 ** 6\n1000000\n```\n\nPython supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order you specify. For example:\n\n```\n>>> 2 + 3*4\n14\n>>> (2 + 3) * 4\n20\n```\n\n### floats \nPython calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can appear at any position in a number.\n\nFor the most part floats can be treated as normal:\n\n```\n>>> 0.1 + 0.1\n0.2\n```\n\nHowever, be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer:\n\n```\n>>> 0.2 + 0.1\n0.30000000000000004\n>>> 3 * 0.1\n0.30000000000000004\n```\n\nPython tries to find a way to represent the result as precisely as possible, which is sometimes difficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally.\n\n### Underscores in Numbers \n\nWhen you\u2019re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores to make large numbers more readable:\n\n```\n>>> universe_age = 14_000_000_000\n>>> universe_age\n14000000000 # Notice how python only prints the digits\n```\n\n### Constants \n\nA constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program. Python doesn\u2019t have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed:\n\n```\nMAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000\n```\n"

But if case doesn\u2019t matter and instead you just want to test the value of a variable, you can convert the variable\u2019s value to lowercase before doing the comparison:\n\n```\n>>> car = 'BMW'\n>>> car.lower() == 'bmw'\nTrue\n```\n\n### Checking for inequality \n\n```\n>>> car = 'Audi'\n>>> print(car != 'BMW')\n\nTrue\n```\n\nThe following table includes various mathematical comparisons: \n\n| Operator | Name                     | Description                                                                 | Example              | Result        |\n|--------:|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| `==`    | Equal to                 | Checks if two values are equal                                              | `5 == 5`             | `True`        |\n| `!=`    | Not equal to             | Checks if two values are not equal                                          | `5 != 3`             | `True`        |\n| `<`     | Less than                | Checks if the left value is smaller than the right value                    | `3 < 5`              | `True`        |\n| `>`     | Greater than             | Checks if the left value is greater than the right value                    | `7 > 4`              | `True`        |\n| `<=`    | Less than or equal to    | Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value           | `5 <= 5`             | `True`        |\n| `>=`    | Greater than or equal to | Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value        | `6 >= 4`             | `True`        |\n| `is`    | Identity                 | Checks if both variables refer to the same object in memory                 | `a is b`             | `True/False`  |\n| `is not`| Negated identity         | Checks if variables refer to different objects                              | `a is not b`         | `True/False`  |\n| `in`    | Membership               | Checks if a value exists inside a sequence                                  | `'a' in 'cat'`       | `True`        |\n| `not in`| Negated membership       | Checks if a value does not exist in a sequence                              | `4 not in [1,2,3]`   | `True`        |\n\n\n$$new_page$$\n\n\nAn if statement allows sections of code to run based on a condition that can either be True or False\n\n```\n>>> if 5 < 10:\n>>>     print(\"True, 5 is less than 10\")\n\nTrue, 5 is less than 10 \n```\n\nMany real-world situations involve more than two possible conditions.\n\nWe can use python's ```if```-```elif```-```else``` syntax\n\nPython executes only one block in an if-elif-else chain. It runs each conditional test in order, until one passes. When a test passes, the code following that test is executed and Python skips the rest of the tests.\n\n```\n>>> age = 12\n>>> if age < 4:\n>>>     print(\"Your admission cost is $0.\")\n>>> elif age < 18:\n>>>     print(\"Your admission cost is $25.\")\n>>> else:\n>>>     print(\"Your admission cost is $40.\")\n\nYour admission cost is $25.\n```\n\nPython does not require an else block at the end of an if-elif chain."

Key commands include:**\n\n- ```CREATE```: To create new objects (e.g., tables, databases).\n- ```ALTER```: To modify existing objects (e.g., add/remove columns, change data types).\n- ```DROP```: To delete objects (e.g., tables).\n- ```RENAME```: To rename objects.\n- ```TRUNCATE```: To remove all data from a table while keeping the structure (technically DML but often grouped with DDL for table management).\n\n**DDL operations are auto-committed in MySQL (no rollback unless in a transaction with InnoDB). They can lock tables, impacting performance in production.**\n\n<hr>\n\n**Database:** Top-level container; holds tables etc. \\\n**Schema:** Synonym for database in MySQL \\\n**SQL Standard:** Schema is usually inside a database; MySQL merges the two concepts\n\n\n```sql\n-- Create a sample database if not exists\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS learning_db;\nUSE learning_db;\n```\n\n<hr><hr>\n\n# Data Types in MySQL\n\n\nUnderstanding data types is crucial before creating tables, as they define how data is stored, validated, and queried. MySQL supports numeric, string, date/time, spatial, and JSON types. Choose types based on data range, storage efficiency, and query needs.\n\n### Common Data Types include:\n\n#### Numeric Types:\n\n```TINYINT:``` 1 byte, -128 to 127 (or 0-255 unsigned).\n```SMALLINT:``` 2 bytes, -32,768 to 32,767.\\\n```INT or INTEGER:``` 4 bytes, -2^31 to 2^31-1 (most common for IDs).\\\n```BIGINT:``` 8 bytes, for large numbers.\\\n```FLOAT/DOUBLE:``` For floating-point numbers (approximate; use DECIMAL for precision).\\\n```DECIMAL(M,D):``` Exact decimal, e.g., DECIMAL(10,2) for currency (up to 10 digits, 2 after decimal).\n    ```\n\n<br>\n\n#### String Types:\n\n```CHAR(M):``` Fixed-length, up to 255 chars (padded with spaces). \\\n```VARCHAR(M):``` Variable-length, up to 65,535 chars (efficient for varying lengths). \\\n```TEXT:``` For long text, up to 65,535 chars (use for >255 chars).\\\n```MEDIUMTEXT/LONGTEXT:``` For even longer text (up to 16MB/4GB).\\\n```ENUM('value1', 'value2'):``` Restricts to predefined values.\\\n```SET('value1', 'value2'):``` Allows multiple predefined values.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Date and Time Types:\n\n```DATE:``` YYYY-MM-DD.\\\n```TIME:``` HH:MM:SS.\\\n```DATETIME:``` YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (stores both).\\\n```TIMESTAMP:``` Similar to DATETIME but auto-updates on insert/update (UTC-based).\\\n```YEAR:``` 4-digit year.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Other Types:\n\n```BOOLEAN or TINYINT(1):``` 0/1 for true/false.\\\n```BLOB/MEDIUMBLOB/LONGBLOB:``` For binary data (e.g., images).\\\n```JSON:``` For structured JSON data (MySQL 5.7+).\n\n<br>\n\n### Best Practices for Data Types\n\n- Use the smallest type that fits your data to save storage (e.g., TINYINT for status flags).\n- Avoid FLOAT for money; use DECIMAL.\n- For strings, prefer VARCHAR over CHAR unless fixed length is needed.\n- Add UNSIGNED for non-negative numbers to double range (e.g., INT UNSIGNED).\n- Use DEFAULT values and NOT NULL to enforce data integrity.\n- Consider character sets (e.g., UTF8MB4 for emojis/multilingual support).\n\n\n**Note:** Data types can be changed later with ALTER TABLE, but it may cause data loss or require table rebuilds (especially in large tables)\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n "

Using ROW_NUMBER() or DISTINCT, SQL effortlessly identifies and eliminates these redundancies:\n\n```sql\nWITH RankedData AS (\n  SELECT *, \n  ROW_NUMBER() OVER \n          (PARTITION BY column_to_check_duplicates ORDER BY id) AS rn\n  FROM your_table\n)\nDELETE FROM RankedData WHERE rn > 1;\n```\n\n<hr>\n\n### 2.\u2753 Handling Missing Values\nMissing data can skew results. SQL offers strategies like imputation or deletion:\n\n#### \ud83d\udeab Removing Rows with NULLs:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM your_table \n    WHERE column_with_missing IS NULL;\n```\n\n<br>\n<hr style=\"width: 50%; margin: auto;\">\n<br>\n\n#### \ud83e\uddee Imputation with Average:\n**COALESCE temporarily fills NULL values during a query without modifying the table.**\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_with_missing, \n       COALESCE(column_with_missing, \n                ROUND((SELECT AVG(column_with_missing) \n                       FROM your_table \n                       WHERE column_with_missing IS NOT NULL), 2)) \n       AS filled_value\nFROM your_table;\n```\n\n<br>\n<hr style=\"width: 50%; margin: auto;\">\n<br>\n\n#### UPDATE permanently replaces NULL values with the column\u2019s average.\n\n```sql\nUPDATE your_table\nSET column_with_missing = (\n  SELECT AVG(column_with_missing)\n  FROM your_table\n  WHERE column_with_missing IS NOT NULL\n)\nWHERE column_with_missing IS NULL;\n```\n\n<hr>\n\n### 3. \ud83d\udd24 Standardizing Data Formats\nInconsistent data formats can be problematic. SQL functions like UPPER(), LOWER(), TRIM(), and CAST() help standardize data:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE your_table\nSET name_column = UPPER(TRIM(name_column));\n```\n\n<hr>\n\n### 4. \ud83d\udcdd Correcting Inaccurate Data\nUsing CASE WHEN statements, SQL allows conditional updates to rectify incorrect entries:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE your_table\nSET status = CASE\n  WHEN status = 'Actve' THEN 'Active'\n  WHEN status = 'Inactve' THEN 'Inactive'\n  ELSE status\nEND;\n```\n\n<hr>\n\n### \n\n### 5.\ud83d\udd12 Validating Data Integrity\nSQL constraints (like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and UNIQUE) enforce data validity right at the database level, preventing dirty data from entering in the first place \ud83d\udea7.\n\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"> \ud83c\udfaf Advanced Data Cleaning Techniques </h1>\n\n<hr>\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Pivoting and Unpivoting Data: Transform datasets for better analysis using PIVOT and UNPIVOT.\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM (\n  SELECT department, month, revenue\n  FROM sales_data\n) AS SourceTable\nPIVOT (\n  SUM(revenue)\n  FOR month IN ([Jan], [Feb], [Mar])\n) AS PivotTable;\n```\n\n<hr>\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Using Window Functions: Analyze data trends and identify anomalies with functions like LAG(), LEAD(), and RANK().\n\n```sql\nSELECT *,\n       LAG(sales, 1) OVER \n                  (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY date) AS Previous_Sales\nFROM sales_data;\n```\n\n<hr>\n\n### \ud83e\uddf9 Regular Expressions (REGEX): SQL\u2019s REGEXP_REPLACE and REGEXP_LIKE functions are powerful for pattern matching and text cleaning.\n\n```sql\nSELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(email, '[^a-zA-Z0-9@._]', '') AS Cleaned_Email\nFROM users;\n```\n\n"

Now if we want to display our aggregated data based off a condition we can use the HAVING clause. \n\nIn the following we:\n- select gender and avgerage age\n- from employee_demographics\n- which is grouped based off the gender ('male' and 'female' are only two unique values)\n- which have an AVG(age) above 40\n\n**Note:** The ***which have an AVG(age) above 40*** refers to the rolled up group of values' average age\n\n<img src=\"static/HAVING_01.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\">\n\nThe above only shows male because the average age of the female gender was below 40. \n\n"

    "content": "<style>\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n    img[style] { width: 90% !important; }\n}\n</style>\n\n# WHERE\n\n<hr>\n\n#### The **WHERE** clause is used to filter rows from a table that meet a specific condition.\n\n#### Instead of selecting all rows, you can narrow down your results based on criteria like job title, salary, or department.\n\n<hr>\n\n**\u2705 Basic Syntax of WHERE**\n\n```SELECT column1, column2```\\\n```FROM table_name```\\\n```WHERE condition;```\n\n<hr>\n\n####\n\n**Parks_and_Recreation example:**\n\nWe are:\n- Selecting everything from the employee_salary table\n- with the condition that salary must be greater than or equal to 50,000\n\n<img src=\"static/WHERE_01.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto; display:block;\">\n\n##\n\nWe can also filter with multiple conditions: \n- Selecting everything from the employee_salary table\n- with the condition that salary must be greater than or equal to 50,000 and dept_id must be equal to 1\n\n<img src=\"static/WHERE_02.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\">\n\n\n## \n\nAdditionally, we can incorporate parentheses into our conditions: \n- By using parentheses, you explicitly group conditions, making your logic clear and accurate.\n- you control the order of evaluation, just like in math.\n\n<img src=\"static/WHERE_03.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\">\n\n## \n\n<hr>\n\n# LIKE\n\n<hr>\n\n#### The LIKE clause is used in a WHERE condition to search for a specified pattern in a column (usually text or VARCHAR fields).\n\n<hr>\n\n**\u2705 Syntax:** \n\n```SELECT column1, column2```\\\n```FROM table_name```\\\n```WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';```\n\n<hr>\n\n**\ud83d\udd21 SQL Wildcards Used with `LIKE`**\n\n| Wildcard | Meaning                                  |\n|----------|------------------------------------------|\n| `%`      | Any number of characters, including 0    |\n| `_`      | Exactly one character                    |\n\n<hr>\n\n**Note:**\n\nMySQL table values can be case-sensitive, depending on the column\u2019s collation settings. \\\nTo ensure case-insensitive matching, use the LOWER() function on both sides of the comparison.\n\n- The following returns all occupations that contain the word 'manager' regardless if it is Manager, MaNaGeR, or Assistant Manager\n\n```SELECT *```\\\n```FROM employee_salary```\\\n```WHERE LOWER(occupation) LIKE '%manager%';```\n\n<hr>\n\n#### \n\nWe are:\n- Querying everything\n- from employee_salary\n- where the first_name value contains 'on' regardless of the position, leading or trailing characters.\n  \n<img src=\"static/LIKE_01.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\">\n\n## \n\nOr we can:\n- Query first and last name\n- from employee_salary\n- where first_name starts with an 'a' and has to have 2 characters after it. ( _ 1, _ 2)\n\n<img src=\"static/LIKE_02.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\">\n\n"

    "content": "<style>\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n    img[style] { width: 90% !important; }\n}\n</style>\n\n# GROUP BY\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Group by rolls up rows that have the same value in one or more columns so that AGGREGATE functions can be performed on each group separately \n\n<hr>\n\nFor the following we are:\n- selecting gender\n- from employee_demographics\n- and we're grouping by gender\n\nNote: Notice that we only get an output of Male and Female. This is because 'male' and 'female' are the only unique values in the gender column. We are rolling up all the values into these unique groups. \n\n<img src=\"static/GROUP_BY_01.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\">\n\n####\n\nIt now makes it easier for us to perform aggregate functions on certain groups based on the other column data. \n\nFor example:\n- we are selecting gender and the average age\n- from employee_demographics\n- and we are grouping by gender. (average age for each rolled up group: male and female)\n\n<img src=\"static/GROUP_BY_02.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\">\n\n**Note:** We can still use aggregate functions without the GROUP BY clause. Note for the following we would not be able to display other columns with it. E.g != AVG(age), gender <- wont work \n\n<img src=\"static/GROUP_BY_03.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\"> \n\n<hr>\n\n### Common aggregate functions: \n\n| Function     | Description                           |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------|\n| COUNT()      | Counts rows in each group             |\n| SUM()        | Adds up values in each group          |\n| AVG()        | Calculates average                    |\n| MIN() / MAX()| Finds smallest / largest value        |\n\n<hr>\n\n# ORDER BY\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Sorts the result in ascending or descending order\n\nBy Default order by sorts in ASC order (not DESC)\n<hr>\n\nFor the following we are:\n- Selecting everything\n- from employee_demographics\n- and we are ordering by gender.\n\n<img src=\"static/ORDER_BY_01.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\"> \n\n####\n\n**Note:** We can also order by on multiple columns. Lets say we were to order by on gender and then age. \n\n<img src=\"static/ORDER_BY_02.png\" style=\"width: 40%; margin: auto;\"> \n\n**Note:** When ordering by on multiple columns, the order is what gives preference. so if we have gender, age - gender will be ordered by first and then age. The order in which you place columns for order by is important. If we were to order by age first and then gender, ordering by gender second would be redundant as preference for age would be determined. \n "

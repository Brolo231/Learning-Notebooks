    "#### Data models define how data is represented and organized in a database. There are two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. High-level Conceptual Data Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on how people perceive and understand data.\n",
    "- Example: Entity-Relationship (ER) Model\n",
    "    - The concept or theory that defines how data can be represented using entities, attributes, and relationships. \n",
    "- Entities represent real-world objects (e.g., Employee, Project).\n",
    "- Attributes describe properties of entities (e.g., name, address, birthdate).\n",
    "- Relationships show associations between entities (e.g., an employee works on many projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Record-based Logical Data Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closer to how data is actually stored on a computer, but still understandable to users.\n",
    "- Includes three main types:\n",
    "- Relational Model:\n",
    "    - Represents data as tables (relations) with rows and columns. Each record (instance) is a row in the table.\n",
    "Example: A “Membership” table with fields like ID, expiry date, and address.\n",
    "- Network Model:\n",
    "    - Represents data as record types connected through set types, showing one-to-many relationships.\n",
    "- Hierarchical Model:\n",
    "    - Represents data as a tree structure, where each branch contains related records in a parent-child relationship.\n",

    "1. What is a data model?\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "A data model is a way to describe how data is structured, stored, and related within a database. It provides a framework for organizing data and defining relationships between data elements.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a high-level conceptual data model?\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "A high-level conceptual data model represents data in a way that is easy for people to understand. It focuses on how users perceive data rather than how it is stored. An example is the Entity-Relationship Model (ERM), which uses entities, attributes, and relationships to describe data.  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is an entity? An attribute? A relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "- Entity: A real-world object or concept that can be identified and stored in a database (e.g., Employee, Project).<br>\n",
    "- Attribute: A property or characteristic of an entity (e.g., Employee Name, Address, Birthdate). <br> \n",
    "- Relationship: An association or link between two or more entities (e.g., an Employee works on a Project).  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. List and briefly describe the common record-based logical data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: lightgreen;\">\n",
    "- Relational Model: Represents data as tables (relations) with rows and columns; each row is a record or instance. <br>\n",
    "- Network Model: Represents data as record types connected through set types that show one-to-many relationships. <br>  \n",
    "- Hierarchical Model: Organizes data in a tree-like structure where each parent record can have multiple child records.  \n",

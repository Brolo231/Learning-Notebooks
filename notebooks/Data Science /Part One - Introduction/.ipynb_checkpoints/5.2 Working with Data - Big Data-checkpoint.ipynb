    "\n",
    "While many techniques for working with **big data** are conceptually similar to those used with traditional data, big data introduces **new challenges related to scale, speed, and variety**. As a result, additional techniques and technologies are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like traditional data, big data must still be **collected, processed, and transformed into usable information**. However, the nature of the data significantly changes *how* this is done.\n",
